full_text: 'SUPERSTITIONS CONCERNING BIRDS

  AMONGST the most remarkable of natural occurrences must be included many of the
  phenomena connected with the behaviour of birds. Undoubtedly numerous species of
  birds are susceptible to atmospheric changes (of an electrical and barometric nature)
  too slight to be observed by man''s unaided senses; thus only is to be explained
  the phenomenon of migration and also the many other peculiarities in the behaviour
  of birds whereby approaching changes in the weather may be foretold. Probably, also,
  this fact has much to do with the extraordinary homing instinct of pigeons. But,
  of course, in the days when meteorological science had yet to be born, no such explanation
  as this could be known. The ancients observed that birds by their migrations or
  by other peculiarities in their behaviour prognosticated coming changes in the seasons
  of the year and other changes connected with the weather (such as storms, etc.);
  they saw, too, in the homing instincts of pigeons an apparent exhibition of intelligence
  exceeding that of man. What more natural, then, for them to attribute foresight
  to birds, and to suppose that all sorts of coming events (other than those of an
  atmospheric nature) might be foretold by careful observation of their flight and
  song?

  Augury--that is, the art of divination by observing the behaviour of birds--was
  extensively cultivated by the Etrurians and Romans.[1] It is still used, I believe,
  by the natives of Samoa. The Romans had an official college of augurs, the members
  of which were originally three patricians. About 300 B.C. the number of patrician
  augurs was increased by one, and five plebeian augurs were added. Later the number
  was again increased to fifteen. The object of augury was not so much to foretell
  the future as to indicate what line of action should be followed, in any given circumstances,
  by the nation. The augurs were consulted on all matters of importance, and the position
  of augur was thus one of great consequence. In what appears to be the oldest method,
  the augur, arrayed in a special costume, and carrying a staff with which to mark
  out the visible heavens into houses, proceeded to an elevated piece of ground, where
  a sacrifice was made and a prayer repeated. Then, gazing towards the sky, he waited
  until a bird appeared. The point in the heavens where it first made its appearance
  was carefully noted, also the manner and direction of its flight, and the point
  where it was lost sight of. From these particulars an augury was derived, but, in
  order to be of effect, it had to be confirmed by a further one.

  [1]This is not quite an accurate definition, as "auguries"

  were also obtained from other animals and from celestial

  phenomena (e.g. lightning), etc.

  Auguries were also drawn from the notes of birds, birds being divided by the augurs
  into two classes: (i) oscines, "those which give omens by their note," and (ii)
  alites, "those which afford presages by their flight."[1] Another method of augury
  was performed by the feeding of chickens specially kept for this purpose. This was
  done just before sunrise by the pullarius or feeder, strict silence being observed.
  If the birds manifested no desire for their food, the omen was of a most direful
  nature. On the other hand, if from the greediness of the chickens the grain fell
  from their beaks and rebounded from the ground, the augury was most favourable.
  This latter augury was known as tripudium solistimum. "Any fraud practiced by the
  ''pullarius''," writes the Rev. EDWARD SMEDLEY, "reverted to his own head. Of this
  we have a memorable instance in the great battle between Papirius Cursor and the
  Samnites in the year of Rome 459. So anxious were the troops for battle, that the
  ''pullarius'' dared to announce to the consul a ''tripudium solistimum,'' although
  the chickens refused to eat. Papirius unhesitatingly gave the signal for fight,
  when his son, having discovered the false augury, hastened to communicate it to
  his father. ''Do thy part well,'' was his reply, ''and let the deceit of the augur
  fall on himself. The "tripudium" has been announced to me, and no omen could be
  better for the Roman army and people!'' As the troops advanced, a javelin thrown
  at random struck the ''pullatius'' dead. ''The hand of heaven is in the battle,''
  cried Papirius; ''the guilty is punished!''

  [1]PLINY: Natural History, bk. x. chap. xxii. (BOSTOCK

  and RILEY''S trans., vol. ii., 1855, p. 495).

  and he advanced and conquered."[1] A coincidence of this sort, if it really occurred,
  would very greatly strengthen the popular belief in auguries.

  The cock has always been reckoned a bird possessed of magic power. At its crowing,
  we are told, all unquiet spirits who roam the earth depart to their dismal abodes,
  and the orgies of the Witches'' Sabbath terminate. A cock is the favourite sacrifice
  offered to evil spirits in Ceylon and elsewhere. Alectromancy[2] was an ancient
  and peculiarly senseless method of divination (so called) in which a cock was employed.
  The bird had to be young and quite white. Its feet were cut off and crammed down
  its throat with a piece of parchment on which were written certain Hebrew words.
  The cock, after the repetition of a prayer by the operator, was placed in a circle
  divided into parts corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, in each of which
  a grain of wheat was placed. A certain psalm was recited, and then the letters were
  noted from which the cock picked up the grains, a fresh grain being put down for
  each one picked up. These letters, properly arranged, were said to give the answer
  to the inquiry for which divination was made. I am not sure what one was supposed
  to do if, as seems likely, the cock refused to act in the required manner.

  The owl was reckoned a bird of evil omen with the Romans, who derived this opinion
  from the

  RICH (1855), p. 144.

  Sciences (1891), pp. 124 and 125.

  Etrurians, along with much else of their so-called science of augury. It was particularly
  dreaded if seen in a city, or, indeed, anywhere by day. PLINY (Caius Plinius Secundus,
  A.D. 61-before 115) informs us that on one occasion "a horned owl entered the very
  sanctuary of the Capitol; . . . in consequence of which, Rome was purified on the
  nones of March in that year."[1]

  The folk-lore of the British Isles abounds with quaint beliefs and stories concerning
  birds. There is a charming Welsh legend concerning the robin, which the Rev. T.F.T.
  DYER quotes from Notes and Queries:-- "Far, far away, is a land of woe, darkness,
  spirits of evil, and fire. Day by day does this little bird bear in his bill a drop
  of water to quench the flame. So near the burning stream does he fly, that his dear
  little feathers are scorched; and hence he is named Brou-rhuddyn (Breast-burnt).
  To serve little children, the robin dares approach the infernal pit. No good child
  will hurt the devoted benefactor of man. The robin returns from the land of fire,
  and therefore he feels the cold of winter far more than his brother birds. He shivers
  in the brumal blast; hungry, he chirps before your door."[2]

  Another legend accounts for the robin''s red breast by supposing this bird to have
  tried to pluck a thorn from the crown encircling the brow of the crucified CHRIST,
  in order to alleviate His sufferings. No doubt it is on account of these legends
  that it is considered a

  [1]PLINY: Natural History, bk. x. chap. xvi. (BOSTOCK

  and RILEY''S trans., vol. ii., 1855, p. 492).

  [2]T. F. THISELTON DYER, M.A.: English Folk-Lore

  (1878), pp. 65 and 66).

  crime, which will be punished with great misfortune, to kill a robin. In some places
  the same prohibition extends to the wren, which is popularly believed to be the
  wife of the robin. In other parts, however, the wren is (or at least was) cruelly
  hunted on certain days. In the Isle of Man the wren-hunt took place on Christmas
  Eve and St Stephen''s Day, and is accounted for by a legend concerning an evil fairy
  who lured many men to destruction, but had to assume the form of a wren to escape
  punishment at the hands of an ingenious knight-errant.

  For several centuries there was prevalent over the whole of civilised Europe a most
  extraordinary superstition concerning the small Arctic bird resembling, but not
  so large as, the common wild goose, known as the barnacle or bernicle goose. MAX
  MUELLER[1] has suggested that this word was really derived from Hibernicula, the
  name thus referring to Ireland, where the birds were caught; but common opinion
  associated the barnacle goose with the shell-fish known as the barnacle (which is
  found on timber exposed to the sea), supposing that the former was generated out
  of the latter. Thus in one old medical writer we find: "There are founde in the
  north parts of Scotland, and the Ilands adjacent, called Orchades [Orkney Islands],
  certain trees, whereon doe growe certaine shell fishes, of a white colour tending
  to russet; wherein are conteined little liuing creatures: which shells in time of
  maturitie doe open, and out of them grow those little living things; which falling

  [1]See F. MAX MUELLER''S Lectures on the Science

  of Language (1885), where a very full account of the

  tradition concerning the origin of the barnacle goose

  will be found.

  into the water, doe become foules, whom we call Barnakles . . . but the other that
  do fall vpon the land, perish and come to nothing: this much by the writings of
  others, and also from the mouths of the people of those parts...."[1]

  The writer, however, who was a well-known surgeon and botanist of his day, adds
  that he had personally examined certain shell-fish from Lancashire, and on opening
  the shells had observed within birds in various stages of development. No doubt
  he was deceived by some purely superficial resemblances-- for example, the feet
  of the barnacle fish resemble somewhat the feathers of a bird. He gives an imaginative
  illustration of the barnacle fowl escaping from its shell, which is reproduced in
  fig. 12.

  Turning now from superstitions concerning actual birds to legends of those that
  are purely mythical, passing reference must be made to the roc, a bird existing
  in Arabian legend, which we meet in the Arabian Nights, and which is chiefly remarkable
  for its size and strength.

  The phoenix, perhaps, is of more interest. Of "that famous bird of Arabia," PLINY
  writes as follows, prefixing his description of it with the cautious remark, "I
  am not quite sure that its existence is not all a fable." "It is said that there
  is only one in existence in the whole world, and that that one has not been seen
  very often. We are told that this bird is of the size of an eagle, and has a brilliant
  golden plumage around the neck, while the rest of the body is of a purple colour;
  except the tail,

  [1]JOHN GERARDE: The Herball; or, Generall

  Historie of Plantes (1597). 1391.

  which is azure, with long feathers intermingled of a roseate hue; the throat is
  adorned with a crest, and the head with a tuft of feathers. The first Roman who
  described this bird . . . was the senator Manilius.... He tells us that no person
  has ever seen this bird eat, that in Arabia it is looked upon as sacred to the sun,
  that it lives five hundred and forty years, that when it becomes old it builds a
  nest of cassia and sprigs of incense, which it fills with perfumes, and then lays
  its body down upon them to die; that from its bones and marrow there springs at
  first a sort of small worm, which in time changes into a little bird; that the first
  thing that it does is to perform the obsequies of its predecessor, and to carry
  the nest entire to the city of the Sun near Panchaia, and there deposit it upon
  the altar of that divinity.

  "The same Manilius states also, that the revolution of the great year is completed
  with the life of this bird, and that then a new cycle comes round again with the
  same characteristics as the former one, in the seasons and the appearance of the
  stars. . . . This bird was brought to Rome in the censorship of the Emperor Claudius
  . . . and was exposed to public view.... This fact is attested by the public Annals,
  but there is no one that doubts that it was a fictitious phoenix only."[1]

  The description of the plumage, etc., of this bird applies fairly well, as CUVIER
  has pointed out,[2] to

  [1]PLINY: Natural History, bk. x. chap. ii. (BOSTOCK

  and RILEY''S trans., vol. ii., 1855, PP. 479-481).

  [2]See CUVIER''S The Animal Kingdom, GRIFFITH''S

  trans., vol. viii. (1829), p. 23.

  the golden pheasant, and a specimen of the latter may have been the "fictitious
  phoenix" referred to above. That this bird should have been credited with the extraordinary
  and wholly fabulous properties related by PLINY and others is not, however, easy
  to understand. The phoenix was frequently used to illustrate the doctrine of the
  immortality of the soul (e.g. in CLEMENT''S First Epistle to the Corinthians), and
  it is not impossible that originally it was nothing more than a symbol of immortality
  which in time became to be believed in as a really existing bird. The fact, however,
  that there was supposed to be only one phoenix, and also that the length of each
  of its lives coincided with what the ancients termed a "great year," may indicate
  that the phoenix was a symbol of cosmological periodicity. On the other hand, some
  ancient writers (e.g. TACITUS, A.D. 55-120) explicitly refer to the phoenix as a
  symbol of the sun, and in the minds of the ancients the sun was closely connected
  with the idea of immortality. Certainly the accounts of the gorgeous colours of
  the plumage of the phoenix might well be descriptions of the rising sun. It appears,
  moreover, that the Egyptian hieroglyphic benu, which is a figure of a heron or crane
  (and thus akin to the phoenix), was employed to designate the rising sun.

  There are some curious Jewish legends to account for the supposed immortality of
  the phoenix. According to one, it was the sole animal that refused to eat of the
  forbidden tree when tempted by EVE. According to another, its immortality was conferred
  on it by NOAH because of its considerate behaviour in the Ark, the phoenix not clamouring
  for food like the other animals.[1]

  There is a celebrated bird in Chinese tradition, the Fung Hwang, which some sinologues
  identify with the phoenix of the West. [2] According to a commentator on the ''Rh
  Ya, this "felicitous and perfect bird has a cock''s head, a snake''s neck, a swallow''s
  beak, a tortoise''s back, is of five different colours and more than six feet high."

  Another account (that in the Lun Yu Tseh Shwai Shing) tells us that "its head resembles
  heaven, its eye the sun, its back the moon, its wings the wind, its foot the ground,
  and its tail the woof." Furthermore, "its mouth contains commands, its heart is
  conformable to regulations, its ear is thoroughly acute in hearing, its tongue utters
  sincerity, its colour is luminous, its comb resembles uprightness, its spur is sharp
  and curved, its voice is sonorous, and its belly is the treasure of literature."
  Like the dragon, tortoise, and unicorn, it was considered to be a spiritual creature;
  but, unlike the Western phoenix, more than one Fung Hwang was, as I have pointed
  out, believed to exist. The birds were not always to be seen, but, according to
  Chinese records, they made their appearance during the reigns of certain

  [1]The existence of such fables as these shows how

  grossly the real meanings of the Sacred Writings have

  been misunderstood.

  [2]Mr CHAS. GOULD, B.A., to whose book Mythical

  Monsters (1886) I am very largely indebted for my account

  of this bird, and from which I have culled extracts from the

  Chinese, is not of this opinion. Certainly the fact that we

  read of Fung Hwangs in the plural, whilst tradition asserts

  that there is only one phoenix, seems to point to a

  difference in origin.

  sovereigns. The Fung Hwang is regarded by the Chinese as an omen of great happiness
  and prosperity, and its likeness is embroidered on the robes of empresses to ensure
  success. Probably, if the bird is not to be regarded as purely mythological and
  symbolic in origin, we have in the stories of it no more than exaggerated accounts
  of some species of pheasant. Japanese literature contains similar stories.

  Of other fabulous bird-forms mention may be made of the griffin and the harpy. The
  former was a creature half eagle, half lion, popularly supposed to be the progeny
  of the union of these two latter. It is described in the so-called Voiage and Travaile
  of Sir JOHN MAUNDEVILLE in the following terms[1]:-- "Sum men seyn, that thei hen
  the Body upward, as an Egle, and benethe as a Lyoun: and treuly thei seyn sothe,
  that thei ben of that schapp. But o Griffoun hathe the body more gret and is more
  strong

  identity of Jean de Bourgogne, a physician at Lige, mentioned

  under the name of Joannes ad Barbam in the vulgate Latin

  version of the Travels." (Note in British Museum Catalogue).

  The work, which was first published in French during the latter

  part of the fourteenth century, achieved an immense popularity,

  the marvels that it relates being readily received by the credulous

  folk of that and many a succeeding day.

  of hem, to drynken of: and of hire Ribbes and of the Pennes of hire Wenges, men
  maken Bowes fulle strong, to schote with Arwes and Quarelle." The special characteristic
  of the griffin was its watchfulness, its chief function being thought to be that
  of guarding secret treasure. This characteristic, no doubt, accounts for its frequent
  use in heraldry as a supporter to the arms. It was sacred to APOLLO, the sun-god,
  whose chariot was, according to early sculptures, drawn by griffins. PLINY, who
  speaks of it as a bird having long ears and a hooked beak, regarded it as fabulous.

  The harpies (i.e. snatchers) in Greek mythology are creatures like vultures as to
  their bodies, but with the faces of women, and armed with sharp claws.

  "Of Monsters all, most Monstrous this; no greater Wrath

  God sends ''mongst Men; it comes from depth of pitchy

  Hell:

  And Virgin''s Face, but Womb like Gulf unsatiate hath,

  Her Hands are griping Claws, her Colour pale and fell."[1]

  We meet with the harpies in the story of PHINEUS, a son of AGENOR, King of Thrace.
  At the bidding of his jealous wife, ID(r)A, daughter of DARDANUS,

  [1]Quoted from VERGIL by JOHN GUILLIM in his

  A Display of Heraldry (sixth edition, 1724), p. 271.

  PHINEUS put out the sight of his children by his former wife, CLEOPATRA, daughter
  of BOREAS. To punish this cruelty, the gods caused him to become blind, and the
  harpies were sent continually to harass and affright him, and to snatch away his
  food or defile it by their presence. They were afterwards driven away by his brothers-in-law,
  ZETES and CALAIS. It has been suggested that originally the harpies were nothing
  more than personifications of the swift storm-winds; and few of the old naturalists,
  credulous as they were, regarded them as real creatures, though this cannot be said
  of all. Some other fabulous bird-forms are to be met with in Greek and Arabian mythologies,
  etc., but they are not of any particular interest. And it is time for us to conclude
  our present excursion, and to seek for other byways.


  THE IMMENSE DUCKPOND PAMPHLET

  A Hooting Yard serial story by Frank Key

  Like Hitler, he took seven sugars in his tea. This had caused some embarrassment
  on his first day at the House. They had to send an urchin scurrying down to the
  cellars to fetch up a fresh tub of sugar. The urchin returned empty-handed, explaining
  that the sugar larder was heavily padlocked. Blodgett was furious. His face growing
  purple, he apologised to Aminadab, rummaged in the cupboard for a stout pick-axe
  and--commanding the urchin to dog his every footstep--he thundered down the stairs
  to the cellar. Shortly afterwards, Aminadab heard the noise of a wooden door being
  smashed to pieces with a metal pick-axe. By the time he was able to drop seven lumps
  of sugar into his cup, the tea was stewed and cold. Blodgett affected not to notice,
  and busied himself with a new trap for flying insect beings.

  Blodgett had been at the House since infancy. He was dyspeptic and cruel. Like Madame
  Rousseau, he had never learned to tell the time and rarely knew what day of the
  week it was. This was surprising for a man in his position, charged as he was with
  running the lower floors of the House. His bailiwick included the frightening rooms
  on the first floor, the whole of the ground floor, the cellars and underground passages
  (except for the secret ones), and various ill-defined sections of the grounds, possibly
  including the boneyards, the engine room, and the pointless hut.

  The arrival of Aminadab dismayed him. He had not been told what on earth to do with
  this lopsided person, which meant he would have to seek instructions from Doctor
  Cack or one of his cronies. He could barely bring himself to speak to them, with
  their supercilious manners, spotless frock-coats, and knot-tying expertise. Blodgett''s
  blood boiled. Without bothering to tell Aminadab where he was going, he shoved the
  trap for flying insect beings back in the kitchen drawer, slammed the door shut
  behind him, and headed off for Doctor Cack''s headquarters.

  Oh dear! Hidden behind an iron chest in the pointless hut, bundled up in sacking,
  there is a dead body. The cause of death is not immediately apparent. In a few weeks
  time, an inquest will be told that the oesophagus contains three or four small items
  of ironmongery. The sacking is mostly burlap.

  Doctor Cack was the foremost potato scientist of his day. He rented a disused Leaking
  Building in the grounds of the House, together with a number of surrounding huts,
  in which he and his team of top flight tuberologists lived and worked. Most of their
  unbearably exciting scientific equipment was located in the Leaking Building, through
  the door of which Blodgett now crashed, breathing heavily through his purple nose.

  "Cack!" he shouted, pronouncing the good Doctor''s name as if he were a chocolate
  swiss roll, or a Battenburg. Towards the back of the Leaking Building stood an enormous
  table on which were stacked flasks, test tubes, scientific hammers, awls, retorts,
  dye buckets, cruet sets, trunnions, shards of propylite, alembics, jars, lenses,
  and a burnt quintain. From behind this agglomeration of rubbish, Ruhugu''s head
  appeared, then the rest of his body. He peered at Blodgett with distaste.

  "Where''s Cack?" yelled Blodgett, repeating his mispronunciation.

  Ruhugu was one of Doctor Cack''s assistants, perhaps the most fanatical. "It''s
  Cack," he said, "To rhyme with Snack."

  Blodgett trembled with rage. "I''ll give you Snack," he rasped, although what he
  meant by this was not entirely clear, even to him. "Cack, Snack, it''s all the same
  to me," he continued, "I don''t care if he''s called Pack, Rack or Glack. He''s
  still a git." He paused long enough for Ruhugu to interrupt.

  "The Doctor is not here at the moment. Why are you flailing your arms around in
  such an alarming fashion?"

  Momentarily disconcerted, Blodgett manoeuvred his hands into his filthy pockets.

  "Thank you," said Ruhugu, "Now, as I explained, Doctor Cack is away. I have important
  potato matters to attend to, so I''d be very grateful if you would turn on your
  heel and begone."

  Blodgett''s temper was getting hotter. Oh, how he would like to immerse Ruhugu in
  a vat of custard, bind him with manacles, belabour him about the temples, and abandon
  him in a ditch! Not necessarily in that order. But of course, Blodgett was a terrible
  coward, and would only attack defenceless tinies, small frail animals, and inanimate
  objects, and only then if he was sure no vengeance would be exacted by some gigantic
  protector. He spat on the floor, whirled around, and clomped out of the Leaking
  Building, cracking his head on the lintel as he did so.

  In the scullery, Aminadab sat slumped at the table. His elbows rested on a grimy
  place-mat, one of a set depicting scenes of Thuringian history. Blodgett had stacked
  most of the set on the dresser, leaving two on the table. Aminadab''s mat showed
  the execution of Konrad Schmid, flagellant King of Thuringia who predicted--inaccurately,
  as it turned out--that the Last Judgement would occur in 1369. In colours that were
  no longer vivid, Schmid''s gruesome face leered out of the flames which were about
  to engulf him. The six other heretics who were burned alongside him at Nordhausen
  in 1368 were curiously absent.

  Aminadab, who had poured his cold tea down the sink, was about to fall asleep when
  Euwige entered the room. She was wrapped in a blotchy shawl, so huge that it trailed
  along the floor behind her. Her corduroy boots had been strengthened with scraps
  of inexpertly-sewn hide from an unidentified quadruped. As she removed her hat,
  she shuddered, her sightless eyes directed at the ceiling.

  "You must come with me," she said. Aminadab looked up.

  "Shall I bring my luggage?" he asked.

  "It might well be for the best," replied Euwige, in a mysterious tone.

  Aminadab loaded himself with his three suitcases, haversack, two satchels, purses,
  vanity bag, cloth hammock, bandbox, badger tin, caddies and punnets, gunny sack,
  reticule, vasculum and duffel bag. Tottering under the weight, he made to follow
  Euwige, but was immediately halted in his tracks when the scullery door banged shut
  behind her. She did not respond to his cries for help, so he was forced to drop
  the vanity bag, bandbox, reticule and one of the punnets, wedge the door open with
  a handy utensil, pick up the items he had let fall--noting that the bandbox was
  irreparably dented--and hurry after her. So bulky was the haversack, however, that
  Aminadab was unable to negotiate the doorway without a struggle, and by the time
  he was free Euwige had vanished around the corner of a sulphurous corridor. By the
  time he reached the spot, she was nowhere to be seen.

  Thinking he could hear her shawl trailing across the floorboards somewhere in the
  distance, he followed on through dingy, unlit corridors, up and down rotten staircases,
  through rooms empty of furniture or life, past gigantic indoor fountains, conservatories
  filled with stinking poisonous spiky foliage, lumber rooms, bookcases stacked with
  editions of the novels of Ayn Rand, cavernous halls, storerooms full of half-dismantled
  tricycles, larders crammed with tins of soup, chambers, parlours and cubicles, ventilation
  shafts, dust holes and laundry rooms.

  Hours passed before he admitted to himself that he was lost.

  In dietary matters, Blodgett deferred to the cook, Mrs Purgative. She was a woman
  of regular habits and iron will. Every day, she prepared four cauldrons of boiling
  soup, for consumption at dawn, mid-morning, mid-afternoon and dusk. Each soup was
  prepared from a different recipe, though Mrs Purgative preferred the antique spelling
  receipt.

  The first soup was a thin clear broth flavoured with kidneys, minnows and saffron.

  The second soup was thick and lumpy, more like a stew or what the Bible calls a
  pottage. Its main ingredients were curds, feverfew, whelks, gin, blood oranges and
  a sort of puddingy sponge of unknown provenance.

  The third soup consisted mostly of duckpond water, into which Mrs Purgative hurled
  delphiniums, muffins, pike and herring, lights, parsley, cocoa and masa harina,
  eggs, toffee apples and cake crumbs.

  Her greatest achievement, though, was the fourth soup. The receipt had taken her
  years to bring to perfection. The base was a thick paste of mugwort, the pulp of
  runner beans, finely ground crocuses, and mustard. This was diluted with boiling
  duckpond water and left to stand for a week, uncovered, out in a field. Brought
  back to the kitchen, the topmost layer of scurf and froth would be drawn off and
  used as a filling for small pancakes with an oaty flavour. The pancakes would be
  tossed into the soup together with mayonnaise, cream crackers, bloaters, pemmican,
  tulip-roots, agar, an ox head, krill, the crushed bones of a swan, whey, turmeric,
  marmalade, groist, badgers'' brains, and spinach. Boiled until it had the consistency
  of mush, the soup would be thinned out with the addition of yet more duckpond water
  and egg custard sherry, and then garnished with brazil nuts and semi-chewed celery
  sticks. Mrs Purgative usually asked Blodgett to do the prepatory chewing.

  At quarterly intervals through the year, she cooked an ample supply of each of the
  four soups. She then supervised the canning process, which was carried out in a
  small factory in the grounds of the House. Once tinned, the soups were stored in
  larders, from where Blodgett or other Blodgett-like figures would collect daily
  supplies. As far as can be ascertained, the soup was the only sustenance officially
  available in the House. Oh, apart from cups of tea, of course.

  The Blodgett figure on the second and third floors of the House was known as Gabbitas,
  although this was not the name he had been born with. Like Blodgett, he had been
  in place for as long as anyone could remember. His nose ran. He was clumsy. His
  disposition was as bleak and unforgiving as Blodgett''s. Gabbitas was astonishingly
  tall--almost seven and a half feet--and his eyes were permanently bloodshot. We
  shall meet with him again, you can count on it.

  In ancient Rome, the haruspices were an order of priests who made prophecies by
  examining the steaming entrails of sacrificially-slaughtered animals. Doctor Cack
  had made a thorough study of their methods, and for the last ten years had been
  engaged in experiments to carry out successful haruspication using mashed potatoes
  instead of entrails.

  Ably assisted by Ruhugu and others, Doctor Cack would lay out the "field", a triangular
  cloth weighted down at each corner by a small piece of bakelite. On to this, a precisely-measured
  amount of mashed potato would be splattered with the agency of an iron spatula.
  A second triangular cloth would be placed atop the resulting mess, and pressed down
  evenly. The upper cloth would then be turned over, and the pattern created by the
  mashed potato which had adhered to it would be examined with great care. Ruhugu
  used his box camera to make a photographic record.

  Divination completed, and notes and annotations pencilled into the foolscap ledger,
  the cloth triangles would be scrubbed clean with a special detergent in readiness
  for the next experiment.

  There were arguments, of course. Moop insisted that only certain potato varieties
  were sufficiently "numinous", as she put it. Maris Pipers, Majestics, and Arran
  Banners met with her approval. Trellis maintained that the waxy texture of the Red
  Craig''s Royal made it the only suitable variety. Strob said the cloths ought to
  be hexagonal. The unhinged Jubble went so far as to suggest using boiled and mashed
  celery instead.

  Ruhugu mediated between the factions, protecting Doctor Cack from turmoil and strife,
  leaving him free to pore over the foolscap ledger, frowning, rapt, determined to
  eke from it whatever revelations it harboured.

  Like the novelist Samuel Richardson, Doctor Cack was an enthusiastic indexer of
  his own work. Even before he arrived at the House, he had been issuing his Bulletin
  Of Potato Science & Related Matters every quarter. The bulk of the contents he wrote
  himself, allowing the occasional interjection from Ruhugu, Moop, Trellis and the
  others. Only Jubble had been barred from its pages, because he was unhinged.

  Every five years, Doctor Cack published, as a separate volume, a cumulative index
  to the Bulletin. His skills lay in thematic rather than purely alphabetic indexing.
  Indeed, Scridge has remarked that, like Prynne''s Histrio-Mastix (1633), Doctor
  Cack''s indices are often more readable than the texts from which they are eked.

  Of the most recent edition of the Quinquennial Collection Of Instructive Sentiments,
  Maxims, Descriptions, Footnotes, Evasions, Queries & Accusations Contained In The
  Bulletin Of Potato Science & Related Matters, Digested Under Proper Heads, Scridge
  reported that he was "driven to hilarity" by the entry for Potato Cyst Eelworm,
  an infection which stunts and withers the crop, with haulm dying down prematurely
  and tubers the size of marbles resulting.

  Of course, Scridge cannot always be trusted, for he is a deceitful toad. There are
  those who assert that he has never read a single word of Doctor Cack''s majestic
  works, indeed that he has never read a single potato-related text in his entire
  sorry life.

  You are already aware that Jubble was unhinged. This had come to light very early
  in his days at the House, so long ago that no one--not even Blodgett--could recall
  precisely what had happened. There were occasional mutterings about a cravat and
  a thunderstorm, but nothing of substance.

  When Doctor Cack had arrived with his hideously food-splattered entourage, Jubble
  had ingratiated himself immediately. He helped the tuberologists to move into the
  Leaking Building, tirelessly destroying with his bazooka the piles of accumulated
  waste materials that had been stored there. He hung their hats up to dry after rainfall.
  He sharpened their pencils. There were other kindnesses.

  Within weeks, Doctor Cack had formally pronounced him as a bona fide assistant potato
  person. Jubble busied himself researching powdery scab, wireworm and spraing. He
  worked hard, and Doctor Cack began to trust him with the more outre aspects of potato
  science. But as the years passed, Jubble became ever more unhinged.

  He was often to be found in uproarious carousal with Euwige, the two of them pouring
  vast quantities of dandelion and burdock down their throats and singing inhuman
  songs. His moustache grew outlandish, and was forever smeared with lemon curd and
  other, sinister curds. He wore hawthorns in his hair, and carried tiny abominable
  homunculi in the pockets of his mackintosh. Doctor Cack had to have words with him
  on this score, for the potato scientist was not a man to tolerate orthodox raincoats.

  Morose and insignificant, dyspeptic and cruel, Blodgett was also a kleptomaniac.
  He would have stolen his own head, given the opportunity. Oh, the things the man
  brought back from his robberies! Pins, litmus paper, zinc, gorse, pie-crusts...
  not even Euwige knew where Blodgett stashed everything, or how he disposed of it
  all.

  Euwige was relentless. She listened out for Blodgett, concealed behind parapets,
  shrubberies, false ceilings. She pried and spied without success. Then she questioned
  him directly. She tied him to a chair and shone a Toc H lamp into his eyes, puffing
  the smoke from her cheroot into his face. He coughed, but was otherwise uncommunicative.
  Later she tried wheedling and deedling, but that didn''t work either. Blodgett remained
  wholly and uncannily silent.

  And still he accumulated tuning forks, dishcloths, cortisone and ironmongery, tin
  baths, cupcake mixture, the heads of oxen, and whisks, and still these things vanished,
  somehow, as if they had never existed in the first place. Like Trellis.

  The tins of soup were stored in a plethora of larders dotted throughout the House.
  Although the location of each larder seemed random--two adjacent here, another just
  down the corridor and around the corner, one tiny, solitary larder in the west wing--in
  fact they were distributed according to a system so stupendous and abstruse that
  only Mrs Purgative understood it. Blodgett claimed to, and no one was confident
  enough of their own knowledge to challenge him.

  Aminadab, having arrived at the House only hours before, was unaware that there
  was even a system in the first place. All he knew for certain was that he was slumped,
  queasy with exhaustion, on the floor of a larder stacked floor to ceiling with soup
  tins marked "Number Three". He had given up the quest for Euwige. Half his luggage
  had been abandoned somewhere back in an ill-lit corridor which stank of porridge,
  though there was no porridge to be found in it. He still had the other half of his
  belongings with him, and was rummaging frantically in one of his satchels for the
  bag of gob-stoppers he had packed at the start of his journey, three weeks ago.

  As his trembling fingers lit at last upon the crumpled bag, he heard footsteps approaching.
  Lurching to his feet, he threw open the door of the larder in desperation. Had Euwige
  come to rescue him?

  Moop''s shoes had been shoved into a red plastic basin on the floor underneath her
  sink. Each tuberologist had their own sink. Doctor Cack had insisted upon it.

  Moop did not use her sink very often. She was more of a field worker, scurrying
  about the grounds armed with a plethora of ludicrous scientific equipment, trailing
  wires and mulverts behind her as she darted from potato patch to potato patch, scribbling
  drivel into her notebook with an exciting new propelling pencil.

  She was a sly one, was Moop. She wrote in Glagolitic script to safeguard her memoranda
  from prying eyes. Several of her projects had only a tangential relationship to
  Doctor Cack''s researches. Had he but known!

  High above the House, fat stars sparkled in the firmament. Unimaginable life-forms
  howled and howled in the darkness. Colonies of nocturnal insects hovered in the
  air at human-head height, buzzing and twanging. Blodgett patrolled the ground floor,
  rattling a monstrous collection of keys, slamming doors shut, sounding the tocsins,
  testing the shutters, checking his fly-traps.

  As he passed the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns, he heard the unmistakeable
  sound of Euwige and Jubble, slurping and belching. They had locked themselves in,
  of course, and barred the door with one of the dandelion and burdock barrels, from
  which they would drink until they were as gassy as gassy could be. Blodgett loathed
  them.

  On the floor above, in one of the larders, Aminadab was embroiled in a fervent debate
  with Trellis, who had come upon him quite by accident. After some initial hesitation,
  they had discovered a mutual interest in--oh, something or other. Beetles, poisonous
  golden toads, David Blunkett, the darning of frayed flags, it could have been anything,
  it hardly matters, it''s all so tiresome. You may as well be reading a penitential
  tract by a, by a horse for all the good it will do you. Night has fallen about the
  House under the twinkling stars. That will do.

  The next day all hell broke loose. Early in the morning, as Blodgett polished the
  outside spigots, an ogre or wild man hove into view atop the southern hills. Its
  progress towards the House was implacable. It stamped through the bracken, vaulted
  the ha-ha with a single bound, negotiated the massive basalt wall with surprising
  elegance, and sprang towards the terrified Blodgett, whirling its hirsute arms alarmingly
  and making disgusting guttural noises. It was matted with filth. Flies, gnats, and
  tiny things emitting poisonous goo crawled all over its flesh. It seemed to be decomposing.
  It drooled. It picked up Blodgett, sank its fangs into his skull, and hurled him
  aside.

  Pausing momentarily to spit out particles of Blodgett''s head, it smashed its way
  through the wall of the House, oblivious to the fact that there was an ajar door
  three feet to its right. Once inside the House, its rage seemed to increase. It
  rushed wildly from room to room, obliterating the furniture, tearing up floorboards,
  destroying chandeliers, bashing holes into walls and ceilings, sucking the wallpaper
  off the walls. It chewed up banister rails and regurgitated them, disgorging them
  with such force that each rail acted as a lethal projectile. At least one urchin
  was impaled as a result. Five minutes after the ogre''s arrival much of the lower
  part of the House lay in ruins. Small fires were starting, but they were doused
  by water spurting from uprooted taps.

  Euwige and Jubble were still sprawled in the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns
  when the ogre eventually came upon them. It let out an inhuman cry. It picked at
  its sores. It became becalmed. Fixing it with a bemused stare, Jubble rose to his
  feet.

  "You know, there might still be some dandelion and burdock left," he said, "Would
  you care for a drop?"

  The ogre pounded its fists against its own head. Then it blinked, shuddered, twitched.
  Jubble pushed a tin mug into its paw. It gulped the sweet muck down greedily, then
  threw the mug back at Jubble, missing his ear by a whisker, as they say. Something
  in its manner seemed to change. By now, blind Euwige too was on her feet. She sniffed
  at the violent pongs emanating from the ogre, then stepped towards it.

  "Thank heaven! You have come!" she said, "Jubble, meet my dear friend Detective
  Captain Unstrebnodtalb! He comes from a far country, and his brain is hot."

  Glagolitic script was invented in the latter half of the ninth century by the monk
  Cyril, who is better known for having devised the alphabet which bears his name,
  Cyrillic. Glagolitic was designed to provide a written rendering of Old Slavonic,
  the language spoken by the Moravians among whom Cyril and his brother Methodius
  were carrying out their holy work. The word glagol, or hlahol, cannot easily be
  translated into English. Its meaning involves the sound of bells and the call to
  the glory of God in worship.

  Moop seems not to have considered such associations when one considers the subject-matter
  of her secretive Glagolitic scribblings. She was embroiled in the study of a fiendish
  species of flatworms known as planaria, which kill and feed on earthworms. The vile
  flatworms excrete an enzyme like a narcotic drug that paralyses an earthworm completely.
  Then they excrete another that dissolves the worm into a sort of soup. Then they
  suck it up. In the space of half an hour, all that remains is a trace of soil from
  the earthworm''s stomach.

  Planaria are successful because they have no known predators. Having no muscles,
  these hideous flatworms simply fall apart if any attempt is made to eat them. Like
  a vagabond horde, planaria are highly mobile, wiping out all the earthworms in one
  area before moving on relentlessly to another. It is not difficult to imagine what
  havoc Moop could wreak in Doctor Cack''s potato-patches by introducing a gang of
  killer flatworms. Let us remember that the good Doctor had entitled a special issue
  of his Bulletin Let Us Now Sing The Praises Of The Humble Earthworm, so essential
  was its contribution to potato cultivation.

  Ruhugu''s tank rumbled to a halt outside the Leaking Building. He clambered to the
  ground, the burnt quintain steady in his grasp. He no longer cared that Jubble had
  almost destroyed it on one of his bonfires. Ruhugu had managed to rescue it in the
  nick of time, singeing his elegantly-manicured hands as he did so. He knew that
  he would need the quintain again, otherwise he would have nothing to tilt at on
  the day of the tourney. So now he seldom let it out of his sight, taking it with
  him even on his regular tank manoeuvres.

  Of course, Ruhugu had reported Jubble''s pyromaniacal tendencies to Doctor Cack,
  but his mentor had been preoccupied. So often in recent weeks Doctor Cack seemed
  a world away. Ruhugu thought it best to leave him be, as the Doctor moped and frowned,
  his brow furrowed, a potato in each hand, a potato in each of his innumerable pockets,
  a potato balanced precariously atop his hat, even a small potato lodged in his mouth.
  Like the Wild Boy of Aveyron, he would utter shrill cries if his potatoes were taken
  away from him.

  It will come as no surprise to reveal that the corpse bundled up in burlap in the
  pointless hut was that of Doctor Cack. He had not been seen for some days. It is
  worth noting that because of the presence of potatoes in and about his body, rigor
  mortis had been delayed. Doctor Cack''s corpse was floppy and malleable, like a
  floppy and malleable thing, by dint of a variety of chemical compounds present within
  the experimental potatoes and their interaction both with the cadaver and with the
  stifling fug of the pointless hut. The names of the chemical compounds are so lengthy,
  and so hard to pronounce, that they shall not detain us here.

  In the Room of Distressed Wooden Bitterns, Euwige cracked open another bottle of
  dandelion and burdock. Celebrations were in order. She and Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb
  had not met for fifteen years, since that time in the aeroplane hangar.

  Then, Euwige had just returned from Slot, where she had torn some paper, arched
  her back like a cat, and stood next to a dam. Unstrebnodtalb was at the hangar to
  meet her, brandishing a trumpet. At this stage in his career, he looked not unlike
  a Hungarian fairground proprietor. He wore spats. He had gabbled at Euwige importunately,
  but his command of human languages was not good, and she had difficulty understanding
  him. Eventually, she had snatched the trumpet from him and beat him over the head
  with it repeatedly, stopping him in mid-gabble. Then she pushed him into a cart
  and rattled off to the House.

  Now, after all those years, they had a lot to catch up on. The walls of the Room
  shook as Unstrebnodtalb told his anecdotes in booming, cataclysmic roars. Jubble
  shoved putty into his ears to dull the racket. But Euwige seemed unperturbed, regularly
  refilling their tin mugs and badgering the Detective Captain with questions. What
  had happened to his spats? Was it true that he had arrested the notorious strangler
  Babinsky, and shaved off his bristly side-whiskers? Was his brain hot? Did moths
  fly about his head? Did he make crunching noises? Why had he not come sooner?

  Unstrebnodtalb, flicking gnats and hornets away from his head, smashed up the empty
  dandelion and burdock bottles with a single thwack from his huge and hairy fists.
  He had his own question for Euwige. What had become of his trusty assistant Aminadab?

  Trellis was mere figment, vapour. He appeared to different people at different times
  as a sort of phantom. He was a tabula rasa, on to which those who met him inscribed
  their dreams, their yearnings, their hallucinations.

  All, that is, except Blodgett, in whose presence Trellis took on a terrifying reality.
  He would snivel, and Blodgett would have to mop up the snivellings with his filthy
  shirt-cuff. He would mewl, and Blodgett would thump him on the head, bruising his
  fist in the process.

  After Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb chewed up part of his head, Blodgett''s relationship
  with Trellis became even more intimate. Trellis would tell Blodgett all about the
  weather in Finland, and the nature of ice, and give him planks, and show him albumen.
  He would invoke disastrous plutonian gods, and have them frolic, miniaturised, before
  Blodgett''s eyes, occasionally tweaking the hairs from his nostrils. In return,
  Blodgett gave Trellis extra helpings of soup, winced at his frailness, concocted
  diverting bedtime stories and nautical yarns, and plied him with raspberries.

  Together, they plotted dark and criminal deeds.

  "I shall soon be in a position to make an arrest," growled Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb
  at breakfast the next morning. Hummingbirds revolved around his head. The scullery
  had been all but obliterated during the master detective''s frenzied arrival, and
  for their breakfast soup the relevant characters had gathered in the stinking yard.

  Late the previous night, as the moon shimmered in the black sky, Unstrebnodtalb
  had come upon Doctor Cack''s corpse. Using detection magnets, and guided by his
  bat-like inner radar, it had taken him just minutes to pin-point the whereabouts
  of the dead potato scientist. His immediate diagnosis was that Doctor Cack had been
  slain with a whelk, a battery, and a puddle of bleach. Further than that he would
  not go, for the time being. The mysterious presence of ironmongery escaped his notice.

  His confidence at breakfast astonished even Euwige. "You know who did the deed?"
  she screeched.

  "Let me say this," howled Unstrebnodtalb, shovelling small insects down his gullet
  and uprooting titanic cedars from the mud, "I delay only so that I can compare notes
  with my esteemed colleague, the sleuth Aminadab. He may be in possession of facts
  material to this foul deed, of information to which I am not privy despite my genius.
  His methods are obscure, but unfailing in their accuracy. The sleuth Aminadab always
  carries with him, in either his satchel or his reticule, a small rectangular tin
  filled with pastilles of a bauxite-like substance which is not actually bauxite
  itself. He carries, too, a portable kiln. Ignited with a simple household match,
  the kiln is coated on the inside with a fuel which produces a temperature of thousands
  of degrees Fahrenheit within two seconds of being lit. It is most uncanny, but I
  have witnessed this happen with my own eyes. Or rather, eye. Into this tiny furnace,
  Aminadab places one of his non-bauxite pastilles, using a long, thin pair of tongs
  which he carries about with him in a special compartment sewn into one leg of his
  pantaloons. He is a resourceful fellow, the sleuth Aminadab. Ten hours later, when
  the kiln has cooled, he prises open its tiny hatch, extracts the charred remains
  of the pastille, and smears it in his hair and upon his brow. Then he packs up the
  portable kiln, after applying a fresh coating of his inexplicable fuel, replaces
  it in his reticule or satchel, and goes about his business." Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb
  stopped howling, and beat his fists on the table, smashing it to pieces.

  "And how does this help him solve the case?" asked the languid Jubble. Unstrebnodtalb
  sank his fangs into a passing horse before responding.

  "It has nothing to do with the deductive abilities of the sleuth Aminadab," he roared,
  "I merely wished to entertain you at breakfast with an anecdote about his untoward
  personal habits."

  It began to rain.


  There were twenty-six ponds in the grounds of the House, of varying sizes. Sixteen
  of them were ponds, and ten were duckponds. One of the duckponds was immense, it
  had claims to be a lake, there was so much water in it.

  Moop trudged around this immense duckpond, her gaze fixed on the mud through which
  she trod. An hour earlier, she had stolen Blodgett''s windcheater while his back
  was turned. It was far too big for her--it was far too big for Blodgett--and the
  hood hid her head completely. She was plunged in reverie. Every now and then, she
  stopped trudging and picked up a pebble to hurl into the immense duckpond, disturbing
  the eerily calm surface of the water. She wondered if the frenzied creature Unstrebnodtalb
  would arrest Trellis.

  As she began her fifteenth circuit of the duckpond, the water was disturbed by something
  larger than her pebbles. With a chthonic churning and squelching, something hideous
  and scarcely describable rose to the surface. It was finned and scaled, but moved
  with robotic precision. It appeared to have a teeming mass of eyes, thousands of
  jellied globules quivering on their stalks. It made no noise. At the sight of it,
  nearby ducks suffered heart-attacks and perished.

  Moop had more presence of mind than a duck. Unleashing a large net, she threw it
  over the hell-spawned aquatic beast-thing, then stunned it with a dart from her
  blowpipe. Binding it firmly with a length of stolen rope she found curled in a pocket
  of Blodgett''s windcheater, she began to drag the nightmare-being back to the Leaking
  Building. It might possibly prove useful in her anti-potato research, she reflected.

  She had gone barely ten paces when the duckpond-monster unaccountably slipped its
  bonds and whacked her on the skull with one of its mighty flippers, knocking her
  unconscious.

  With his mighty paw, Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb was about to scratch a bloody
  X on the forehead of Doctor Cack''s murderer when his esteemed colleague the sleuth
  Aminadab came crashing on to the scene. He was carrying a punnet full to the brim
  with odd and inconsequential objects, which he proceeded to describe to Unstrebnodtalb
  at length. Readers avid for the details should send an email headed Please tell
  me what was in the sleuth Aminadab''s brimming punnet, to which the author will
  reply individually, to the point of tedium.

  But Aminadab''s rambling drivel cannot be allowed to keep us from the denouement
  of this exciting story.

  "Hush! Hush! Aminadab, you are a sleuth about whom legends will accrete, but for
  the love of G-d hold your tongue!" screeched Unstrebnodtalb, setting fire to a small
  herb garden with a blast of his breath.

  Aminadab unzipped himself from his terrifying aquatic monster costume and placed
  his punnet on a flagstone next to one of Blodgett''s fly-traps.

  "You would do well to pay attention to my rambling drivel, Detective Captain Unstrobnedtalb,"
  he said, "For it is only because I carry with me at all times a vial of cassiber
  serum that I am able to assist you in bringing this case to a satisfactory conclusion.
  The deranged potato scientist Moop stunned me with an incredibly powerful poisonous
  dart from her blowpipe. By rights I should be in a coma. As it is, I had a split
  second in which to bite on a serum pill and thus outwit her!"

  Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb clawed at the sky, wailing horribly. "Very clever,
  Aminadab. But stop calling me Unstrobnedtalb, G-d damn you!"

  While the two detectives were occupied with this banter, the culprit fled into the
  crumbling ruins of the House, forehead yet unmarked with an X.

  Blodgett suffered dreadfully from yaws, but the condition cannot excuse his behaviour.
  Yaws is also known as framboesia. Blodgett was also known as Jubble. The deception
  had been difficult. Sometimes he had had to be in two places at once. Moop had been
  willing to impersonate him from time to time, no questions asked. She had been a
  useful ally, but he had begun to distrust her. She would be the next to go, after
  Ruhugu. Preening his mustachios, he cackled, as if he were a character in a nineteenth
  century melodrama.

  The sleuth Aminadab felt it was time to retire. This had been his ten thousandth
  case, quite enough for any detective. He and Unstrobnedtalb, or Unstrebnodtalb,
  whatever his name was, had parted as dawn broke on the Thursday morning. They had
  stood triumphantly, arm in arm, each with a foot--or in Unstrebnodtalb''s case,
  more properly a hoof--planted on the dead body of Blodgett, or Jubble.

  The end had been horrifying, and very messy. They had had to call on Euwige to help,
  and by the time they realised the scimitar had not been sharpened it was too late.
  Afterwards, Euwige and Moop got rid of the corpse. The distant splash led Aminadab
  to conclude that Blodgett/Jubble''s body ended up in one of the twenty six ponds,
  but he didn''t really care which one.

  Three weeks later, when he returned home, he wrote up the case as usual. Fuelled
  by dandelion and burdock and bilgegrew buns, he sat late into the night engraving
  his zincographs. Half of what he wrote was lies, of course. Unstrebnodtalb hardly
  featured in the Aminadab version. Moop and Trellis virtually disappeared, although
  he awarded them a footnote in a sentimental moment.

  He was, as usual, merciless with himself. If anyone ever bothered to read the narrative,
  they would surely conclude that the sleuth Aminadab didn''t have a clue what was
  going on, and still didn''t twig what had actually happened even at the end, as
  he bid farewell to Detective Captain Unstrebnodtalb, his absurd agglomeration of
  luggage long abandoned save for the punnet and reticule, enormous birds beating
  their enormous wings around him as he stood ankle-deep in mud, weird and hapless,
  at the very edge of the immense duckpond.
