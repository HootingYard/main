  "Now and again, it will do you a power of good to spend a Wednesday morning tramping
  along a high ridge, blowing a trumpet and waving a banner. If you can persuade others
  to join you, so much the better. It will not matter if you are tuneless and raggle-taggle--the
  experience itself can pump vital energy into your blood, oxygenating your brain
  and feeding crucial nutriments into your integuments."

  That is the advice I was given by my mentor, or at least by a book handed to me
  by my mentor on the day I said farewell to him for the last time. It was not a day
  I am likely ever to forget. After the dawn calisthenics, we had sausages for breakfast.
  I have never tasted the like, before or since. God only knows what they were made
  of. Ambrosia, perhaps, or manna. My mentor was kind enough, for once, to overlook
  my disgusting table-manners, even going so far as to hand me several extra napkins
  from his precious supply. When I had finished mopping up my drool and spillages,
  he beckoned me with the Claw Of Gack, and we headed off up into the hills to that
  lair of his which until now had been forbidden to me. Had I not eaten such a gigantic
  breakfast, my heart would have been palpitating. As it was, my corporeal being was
  preoccupied with its digestive functions, freeing my brain to do the palpitations.

  Once inside the lair, or cave, my mentor handed me a trumpet and a banner and the
  book which I have already mentioned, and then he vanished in a puff of inexplicable
  roseate vapour. I was alone. I waited for the vapour to disperse and then I strode
  out of the cave... no, I must not lie, I minced out of the cave, and I tumbled down
  the hillside, battering my trumpet in the process, and I rummaged around in my mentor''s
  pantry until I found more sausages, and while I cooked them I practiced a few toots
  on the trumpet, and I read the book--the passage quoted above comprises the complete
  text--and then I unfurled my banner. And when I had finished eating all of the sausages,
  I set out to make my own way in the world.

  HOW I PLUNGED INTO THE BOTTOMLESS VIPER-PIT OF GAAR

  For too many years to count I travelled the world visiting bottomless viper-pits.
  I studied them, sketched them, photographed them, and wrote up lengthy and detailed
  descriptions of each and every one. My patience is almost inhuman, and it needed
  to be, because sooner or later some well-meaning numbskull would ask, in relation
  to this or that bottomless viper-pit, "Tell me, Professor Bindweed, if the viper-pit
  is bottomless, where in heaven''s name are the vipers?" And each time I would sigh,
  and give my interlocutor a look of saintly forebearance, and reply, "On ledges,
  of course, from very near the top and then at intervals of a few feet all the way
  down!" For in my experience this was invariably the case, from the bottomless viper-pit
  of O''Houlihan''s Wharf to the bottomless viper-pit of San Christoboole.

  Then, one day, armed only with the shreds of a map and a flask of brackish water,
  I came upon the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar. One thing you must understand is that
  I had been at this work for so long that very little surprised me anymore. So please
  do not think I am exaggerating when I say that I was thunderstruck, bedazzled, giddy
  and incredulous, for I was all those things and more. The amazing thing about the
  bottomless viper-pit of Gaar was that it had been turned into a sort of tourist
  attraction. A fence had been placed around it, gigantic gaudy signs flashed on and
  off, and fairground music blared out of stacks of loudspeakers. To exploit one of
  the remotest bottomless viper-pits in the world for commercial gain seemed wrong
  to me, and, suddenly drained of my inhuman patience, I marched up to the person
  standing behind the counter of the ticket booth.

  I ranted and raved at him for at least five minutes, shouting my head off and flailing
  my arms, and do you know what? He took absolutely no notice of me. This enraged
  me even further, and I was about to give him a clean, decent sock on the jaw when
  I heard running footsteps behind me and a withered voice croaking "Wait! Wait!"
  I turned to see an unkempt beanpole of a fellow hastening towards me. He slowed
  up, wheezing, and staggered the last few steps.

  "Don''t harm the lad, please, sir. He''s a good worker, takes the cash and hands
  out the tickets. His name is Tommy. He''s a deaf, dumb and blind kid, sure plays
  a mean pinball." I looked back at the urchin and, sure enough, he bore a striking
  resemblance to Roger Daltrey circa 1969. I harrumphed.

  "Would you be wanting to buy a ticket then, sir?" asked the beanpole.

  I think my reply, a speech based on a lecture I had given at the Bottomless Viper-Pit
  Club Of Helsinki a decade ago, took about an hour to deliver. I am not sure how
  much of what I said got through to the lanky ingrate. I do know that he sat down
  on a nearby tuffet as exhaustion set in, that Tommy packed up and went home, that
  I inserted some new rhetorical tricks into my tirade, that clouds scudded across
  the sun and that the sun itself set before I had finished. My listener had now fallen
  into a deep sleep asprawl his tuffet. Ignoring him, I clambered over the wicket
  gate that the pinball wizard had locked before he left, and approached the bottomless
  viper-pit of Gaar with mounting excitement. It was dark and I had no torch, but
  I picked my way carefully towards the edge of the bottomless viper-pit. I laughed
  aloud with glee as I heard the familiar hiss of countless pit-vipers. The years
  seemed to fall away, and I felt again that tingle of unalloyed happiness that I
  experienced when, as a spindly twelve-year-old, I had accompanied my father to the
  bottomless viper-pit of Shoeburyness, my very first bottomless viper-pit. A knot
  of nostalgia tightened in my stomach. I put my hand up to my hat, and doffed it.
  It was my father''s hat, the one he had given to me on that very day, the same hat
  which he had brandished to ward off a particularly malevolent pit-viper that was
  about to sink its fangs into my heart.

  I doffed my father''s hat, and I plunged into the bottomless viper-pit of Gaar.


  MISPRINTS

  Yesterday''s piece by Professor Bindweed, How I Plunged Into The Bottomless Viper-Pit
  Of Gaar, contained a number of errors. These were due to production problems, escaping
  gas, an unexpected teabag mishap, and the distractions of a choir belting out Shenandoah
  at top volume. At Hooting Yard, however, we pride ourselves in setting the record
  straight at the very earliest opportunity.

  There were three misprints, and they were of a kind. As several readers have pointed
  out with commendable promptness, there are no bottomless viper-pits at O''Houlihan''s
  Wharf or at Shoeburyness, and there is no such place as San Christoboole. Let us
  take each one in turn, in reverse order.

  San Christoboole does not exist, at least not in any atlas I know of, and it is
  difficult to know which bottomless viper-pit Professor Bindweed had in mind. It
  may be an anagram of Basoonclotshire, but my well-thumbed gazetteer of that bosky
  paradise-on-earth states specifically (page 1,249) that "there are no viper-pits
  in the county, bottomless or otherwise". Incidentally, the name of the shire has
  nothing to do with bassoons, hence the spelling. The derivation is from basin. I
  am reminded that readers have long been promised a series of articles on the important
  topic of basins, and these are currently in preparation, so please stop sending
  those pleading emails.

  For Shoeburyness, read Lytham St Annes.

  To think for one minute that there could be a bottomless viper-pit at O''Houlihan''s
  Wharf is so preposterous I am surprised the globe kept spinning on its axis after
  this howler appeared here yesterday. As soon as the error was brought to my attention,
  I fired off an apology to the Five Fiendish Burghers of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, terrified
  as I was of swift and brutal reprisals. I received a very gracious acknowledgement,
  which I am happy to reprint below:

  "O Key! We, we, we, we, we, the Five Fiendish Burghers of O''Houlihan''s Wharf,
  that is, first Godsoke, second Pardew, third Cansegmabulbadette, fourth Pip, and
  fifth Billy Strayhorn, do hereby say to you in arch lewd monstrous grating swinish
  implacable hoarse declamation, and then in the ululatory incantation of a muezzin,
  that we, we, we, we, we have taken unto our bodices and tunics the sentiments of
  your piteous grovelment and we, we, we, we, we have pronounced it good. The battalions
  of the O''Houlihan''s Wharf Avengement Platoon have been called off, before they
  even had time to mount their hideous macroencephalic horses, yes!, the hideous macroencephalic
  horses, with their fierce biting spittle-flecked fangs, that gallop at double the
  speed of light! Don''t let it happen again."

  I have promised my new pals, the Burghers, who are coming round for tea later on
  today, to write something accurate and complimentary about O''Houlihan''s Wharf
  in the near future.


  WAFERS, VILE AND OTHERWISE

  Speaking of vile wafers, as Antoine Simon Maillard does in the quotation above,
  reminds us that "vile" is one of the varieties of wafer available from the kiosk
  behind the post office in O''Houlihan''s Wharf. Unlike most wafers, which tend by
  definition to be thin, the vile wafer is as thick as the old Penguin English Library
  edition of Moby-Dick; or, The Whale by Herman Melville, which, with its introduction
  and commentary by Harold Beaver, comes to over a thousand pages.

  (If I may digress for a moment, I have always been enamoured of Mr Beaver''s note
  on the line "all bats; and I''m a crow" on page 545 of this edition--the note itself
  appears on page 885. Beaver writes, inter alia, As crow to the house of Cawdor (''in
  the whirled woods, the last day of the year!'') Pip prophesies doom; all turned
  to bats at dusk; all screwy-whirled; all mad.)

  According to the O''Houlihan''s Wharf Market Research Bureau (whose office, by the
  way, is a shabby lean-to tacked on to the post office) sales of vile wafers are
  down this year, a worrying trend given that wafers in general are enjoying peak
  performance in the economy of this godforsaken hellhole by the boiling sea.

  (Forgive a second digression... I know I said yesterday that I would be complimentary
  about O''Houlihan''s Wharf, but sometimes the truth will out.)

  Anyone examining the pie charts, graphs, Blotzmann diagrams and other impenetrable
  flummery in the latest edition of the O''Houlihan''s Wharf Market Research Bureau
  Bulletin Of Underlying Trends In Trading Patterns Of Wafers From The Kiosk Behind
  The Post Office, as I have done, repeatedly, will find it hard to disagree with
  the view of one focus group member, who is reported as saying "No one wants to buy
  the vile wafers because they are as thick as a hefty paperback, and we prefer our
  wafers thin. Is that so wrong?"

  The latest tracker poll suggests that the most popular wafers are hot wafers, clinging
  wafers, gas-enhanced wafers, pituitary-gland wafers, pip-strewn wafers, and, tellingly,
  Arpad''s special wafer-thin wafers. The latter, for example, outsold vile wafers
  by more than ten thousand percent, if that means anything, arithmetically, or mathematically,
  or both. I am particularly charmed by the Bulletin''s graphic illustrating this
  point, because if you turn it sideways it looks like a cartoon face of Jeb Magruder
  of Watergate fame. I dropped my copy of the Bulletin into a puddle of bubbling,
  viscous green fluid outside the Convent Of Our Lady Of Resignation And Dismay, so
  unfortunately I cannot reproduce it here. A photograph of wily Jeb, taken before
  he went to prison and became a born-again Christian, will have to suffice.


  Interestingly, there are distinct parallels between the wafers on sale in O''Houlihan''s
  Wharf and the Watergate scandal, not least among them being that the kiosk''s owner''s
  name is Chuck Colson, just like President Nixon''s Special Counsel. Our Colson,
  the wafer merchant, is a lifelong resident of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, and indeed has
  only left that wretched brine-soaked eyesore once in his life, when he was mistakenly
  called to testify before Judge John J Sirica at the hearings in Washington DC. Thankfully,
  the error was realised while kiosk-man was waiting at the railway station in Strontium
  90 Township, just a few miles away. He returned home the same day, celebrating his
  near-brush with fame by tucking into a slap-up dinner of baked swan a la Maxwell
  Davies.

  Personally, I find it just a little unsettling that Colson never eats his own wafers,
  even the wafer-thin ones. I decided to put this to him and wrote a carefully-worded
  letter requesting an interview, but answer came there none. Now I am not given to
  harrying wafer-kiosk-persons as a matter of course, but nor will I allow them to
  vend wafery produce they themselves eschew without giving me a damned good explanation.
  That''s the kind of narrator I am.

  Unable to pursue Colson myself, having come down with a case of seeds-in-the-vitals
  which necessitated complete bed rest, I employed a private detective by the name
  of Istvan Plunkett to act on my behalf. This Plunkett was a curious combination
  of elegance, rattiness and allergies. I never did quite get the measure of him.
  As far as I could gather, he existed on a starvation diet, berries mostly, and rainwater.
  Certainly he was not a man to feed on swans, irrespective of whether they had been
  accidentally electrocuted or not.

  Tragically, the assignment on which I sent him proved to be Plunkett''s last case.
  I did not hear from him for months on end, and was in any case losing interest in
  the doings of a self-hating wafer-salesman from O''Houlihan''s Wharf, having better
  things to do with my time, such as trying out that berries-and-rainwater diet myself.
  Then one morning I read in The Daily Dripfeed a short item noting that an elegant,
  ratty and allergy-prone private detective had been found dead in a thicket of gorse
  bushes and bracken. Apparently the wires of his portable metal tapping machine had
  become entangled in the foliage and he had been too bloody cack-handed to extricate
  himself. I crumpled up the newspaper and tossed it into a disposal chute, and I
  said a prayer for Plunkett. It was not a long prayer, nor was it a well-written
  one. I think it had been translated from Glosa, the artificial international language
  which rivals Esperanto. Then I went home and opened my copy of Moby-Dick; or the
  Whale, by Herman Melville and read Pip prophesies doom; all turned to bats at dusk;
  all screwy-whirled; all mad, and I sank my teeth into a vile wafer, and out in the
  spinney I knew that dozens upon dozens of swans were gathering, whooper swans, whooping,
  whooping, magnificent, and so very alive..


  A PEDANT''S RIGHTEOUS NOSTRUMS

  It has to be said that most of the inhabitants of O''Houlihan''s Wharf are not worth
  writing about. They are, with few exceptions, a grey and insipid bunch. One of those
  exceptions, however, is the pedant from whose pen streams a series of righteous
  nostrums, or possibly nostra, regularly sent out into the world, or at least into
  this bilgewater-befouled corner of it, posted as they are on a noticeboard outside
  the pet shop, from which they are rapidly torn down and stuffed into the pockets
  of those citizens who collect them with something approaching mania.

  Three questions present themselves to the inquiring mind. Who is this pedant? What
  are his nostrums? And are they righteous?

  I do not have an inquiring mind, at least not today, for I am too busy putting the
  finishing touches to my Taxonomy Of Swans in tin, wood, grease and sand, an imposing
  sculpture which has not yet found a buyer and may therefore remain wedged into my
  bathroom for years to come. But I know that readers will be curious about the pedant
  and his nostrums and their righteousness, so I asked Dr Ruth Pastry to investigate.

  Now Dr Pastry and I have a somewhat fraught relationship. Many moons ago, we got
  into an argument about that anonymous 18th century suicide note which reads, in
  its entirety, "All this buttoning and unbuttoning". I cannot recall the substance
  of our dispute, only that harsh and unforgivable words were exchanged, saucepans
  hurled--one still brimful of an appetising soup--and threats levelled against pets,
  to wit, a tortoise and a goose. The tortoise was mine, the goose Dr Pastry''s. In
  the end, neither of them came to any harm, at least not immediately, although of
  course the ravages of the passing years took their toll, and both of them are now
  dead and gone, Diego the tortoise in a maelstrom and Rex the goose in a railway
  accident.

  Very much alive, though, is the feud between me and Dr Pastry, and it was with a
  view to ending it that I invited her help with the pedant and his righteous nostrums.
  It was the sort of assignment I thought she would enjoy, given her fondness for
  both pedants and nostrums. I was wrong. Here is what she wrote in reply to my invitation.

  "For the love of heaven, Key! What makes you think for one moment that I would ever
  again set foot in that confounded sea-girt wasteland? The last time I went to O''Houlihan''s
  Wharf I was young, cheery, and full of beans, a bluestocking with the glint of glory
  in my bright blue eyes. Two hours after cycling into town with a pannier full of
  Proust, I was sprawled on a heap of pebbles, stinking of the sea, a prematurely-aged
  drudge with gnats in my hair, pustules on my brow, and a belly full of 90% proof
  egg nog. Don''t get me wrong, I don''t blame the shrivelled and witless O''Houlihan''s
  Wharfites. It is simply the spirit of the place. It does that to a person, even
  to me. Well, never again. Your pedant with his nostrums can go hang. I am going
  out to the cemetery now to place a bunch of peonies and flax on poor Rex''s tomb,
  and as I do so I will curse you again and again, as I have cursed you every single
  day since the buttoning and unbuttoning business first flared. Adieu."

  Clearly, if I was going to satisfy my readers'' curiosity about the pedant and his
  nostrums and their righteousness, I would have to think again. Dr Pastry seemed
  in no mood to make peace, and I was not sure I would be able to change her mind.

  All of which, I suppose, goes to explain why I found myself hopelessly lost in the
  dark, dark woods as midnight struck. With Dr Pastry down the pan, as it were, I
  worked desultorily at the Taxonomy of Swans, my mind buzzing away trying to think
  of someone else who might be able to help. As I tamped a fistful of grease into
  a knothole, I suddenly remembered the old blind woodcutter. It was true that he
  knew nothing of O''Houlihan''s Wharf, but, I reasoned, that might work to my advantage.
  Dipping my hands into a tub of swarfega, I tried to recall his telephone number.
  He had made we swear never to write it down, and I had honoured my promise, partly
  out of rectitude and partly because he said that if I broke my word he would send
  a sloth of slow, lumbering bears to smother me in my bed. His sightless eyes gleamed
  dangerously in the candlelight as he said this, and I realised that the story about
  how Old Ma Bagshaw met her end suddenly made sense. "My word is my bond," I mumbled,
  and the old blind woodcutter cackled.

  Now, though, twenty years later, with the Soviet Union long collapsed, I simply
  could not remember that damned number. I realised I would have to set off into the
  dark, dark woods and find the old blind woodcutter''s crumbling cottage, and ask
  him face to face. I tacked the end of a length of string to my gate, and paid it
  out behind me as I walked, each step taking me further and further from the comforts
  of home, and the unfinished Taxonomy of Swans, and closer to the perils of the dark,
  dark woods.

  Had I known that my neighbour''s eagle, Simon, had swooped out of the sky within
  minutes of my departure, and bitten the end off the string, because it smelled of
  hamster, I would have stopped then and there. In my ignorance, of course, I tramped
  on, little knowing that, like the answers, my friend, my string, the string that
  should see me safely home, was blowin'' in the wind.

  And the answers to my three questions, about the pedant of O''Houlihan''s Wharf,
  and his nostrums, and the righteousness of his nostrums, they too are blowin'' in
  the wind, for what hope do I have of discovering them now, in this Stygian darkness?
  It is midnight. I am encircled by enormous trees. The duff underfoot is musty and
  damp and alive with tiny biting creatures. There is no trace of the old blind woodcutter''s
  cottage. Perhaps I only ever imagined him. My hands still stink of swarfega. It
  is midnight, and pitch black, and I have been wandering these dark, dark woods for
  a hundred years.'
