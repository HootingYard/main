full_text: 'A THRILLING YARN

  I was invited to tour the sheds, so I wore a pair of gloves.

  Have you got that so far? Sheds, gloves.

  The snow was thick so we were preceded by a snowplough the engine of which ran on
  a fuel of uncertain origin.

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel. Make a note.

  When I say that the origin or provenance of the fuel was uncertain, I mean that
  I did not know of it, not that it was unclear to those people who know their snowploughs
  and other vehicles. Of course they knew where their fuel came from. I did not need
  to know.

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles. Are you beginning to see
  where this leads?

  As soon as we got inside the first shed on the tour I removed my gloves and put
  them on a shelf above a gas heater. How they managed to pipe gas out here was something
  else I did not know. We were meant to have a picnic in this first shed but no one
  had remembered to bring the hamper.

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper.

  Bursting with inhuman courage I volunteered to return to the biddyhouse alone, to
  fetch the hamper. Various half-hearted attempts were made to dissuade me, but I
  waved them aside with my now ungloved hands. It has to be said that my waves were
  theatrical, even melodramatic, but I enjoyed the sensation. I could feel my blood
  pumping through my veins.

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper,
  biddyhouse, waves, blood. Stop me when you''ve cottoned on.

  I left my gloves on the shelf above the gas heater and went out into the snow. Without
  a compass, I strode off in what proved to be completely the wrong direction. Instead
  of reaching the biddyhouse where I would find the hamper and heave it on to my shoulder
  and take it back to shed number one for the picnic, I found myself lost, and not
  only lost, but encircled by wolves. The wolves each had a dusting of fresh snow
  on their backs. I took this to mean that they had been standing around for a while,
  waiting for me.

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper,
  biddyhouse, waves, blood, compass, wolves.

  I counted seventeen snow-covered wolves. They remained perfectly still, looking
  at me. Nursery rhymes are a godsend in such circumstances, at least that has been
  my experience. I began with Ring a ring a roses and then did Little Jack Horner.
  Not a single wolf moved a muscle. It then dawned on me that they were all blind.
  Blind wolves in the snow! And me lost, and without my gloves, and ignorant of fuel
  sources! And further than ever from the picnic hamper! What a predicament! Or was
  it? You be the judge. Now listen, just once more...

  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper,
  biddyhouse, waves, blood, compass, wolves, roses, muscles, dawn, blind.

  All should now be clear, as clear as the sky was on that cold bright morning in
  September, forty miles north of Helsinki, the capital city of Finland, founded as
  long ago as 1550 as a rival to the Hanseatic city of Tallinn.


  PABSTUS TACK

  This piece first appeared in September 2005.

  Pabstus Tack, Pabstus Sludge, Pabstus! Pabstus! Of him we sing. We sing his praises,
  it seems to me, for want of anything better to do. Pabstus Tack sits on his great
  golden throne, belching out light, a blinding light as gorgeous as it is uncanny.
  And yet it is an impure light, that is certain, for with Pabstus Tack comes Pabstus
  Sludge. It is the latter who is the source of those scarcely perceptible low booming
  noises, grave and deep and sinister.

  When Pabstus! Pabstus! was installed on his throne there was carnival and carousing.
  Fools danced around maypoles and jesting roisterers roistered and doistered as if
  tomorrow would never come. No one has ever been able to count the pies that were
  cooked that day. Many, many people drowned at the swimming gala at the Old Crumbling
  Outdoor Pool, and ravens were seen hovering in the sky. A post office person stuck
  pictures of Pabstus Tack to his hat and was chased across the fields by happily
  screeching children. But was there a trace of desperation in their screeching?

  And tomorrow did come, of course, as everyone knew it had to. That was when the
  first rumbles were heard of Pabstus Sludge. To appease him, the throne was moved
  to a higher point on the hill, just above the coppice, where moles betrayed their
  presence in their usual mole-like way. A gang from the tavern headed thither armed
  with rifles, until Pabstus! Pabstus! made it known that moles were sacred and must
  never be harmed. Some say the men turned their rifles on themselves in terror.

  Terror, it is said, is the only proper response to Pabstus Tack and to Pabstus Sludge.
  Wrapped up tight in their cardigans, hanging Tilly lamps from the rafters of their
  cabins, the braver villagers plot his overthrow. Turnips are chewed. Cigarillos
  dangle from the soot-blackened lips of the vanguard. Secret anthems, never written
  down, are mumbled rather than sung. Food poisoning has wiped out most of these souls
  since Pabstus! Pabstus! first emitted his light and his booms, seventeen years ago.

  The throne has been moved again, moved and reinforced. Now it is perched on a sort
  of concrete veranda by the edge of a lake in which only puffy and bloated fish may
  swim. Larval creatures are strewn on the shore, watched over by one of Pabstus Tack''s
  lieutenants. The air is thick, clotted, far too hot for this region. With each faint
  boom from Pabstus Sludge, the shoreline creatures twitch. It is never dark here,
  thanks to Pabstus Tack.

  Between the lake and the coppice lies the village. A deranged tangle of overhead
  wiring stretches beyond the horizon, supported on high wooden poles which sway and
  creak in the constant wind. Nowadays children are no longer taught to sing "Pabstus
  Tack, Pabstus Sludge, Pabstus! Pabstus! made the wind / Pabstus made it because
  we sinned", but they should be. It is dangerous to forget.


  MAX

  Continuing with correspondence received during Hooting Yard''s break, the estimable
  Max Decharne sent this:

  Some years back I bought an old book called New Familiar and Progressive English
  and French Dialogues (With Dialogues on Railway and Steamboat Travelling, and a
  Comparative Table of Monies and Measure) by Richard and Quetin, published by Hachette,
  1876, which I was recently looking through again, and it remains one of the finest
  phrase books I''ve ever encountered.

  Some of it sounds like the dialogue from a porn film: ''You oblige me in so willing
  a manner, that it encourages me to apply to you again and again'', ''I am delighted
  that you make use of me so freely'', ''You may dispose of me as you will'', ''It
  is impossible to do a favour in a more pleasing manner'' ''I have never experienced
  such satisfaction'', ''I believe I shall go mad with pleasure''.

  Then there''s the section entitled ''To express horror and fright'': ''It is abominable,
  horrid, infamous'', ''It is violating all that is most sacred in nature'', ''It
  is enough to freeze one''s blood with horror'', ''There never was anything seen
  so abominable'', ''The mind revolts from the idea of such a crime''.

  Or perhaps, when visiting those tourist spots in Paris, and one feels the need to
  ''express dipleasure and grief'': ''I am ruined beyond remedy'', ''My misfortunes
  are at their height'', ''I am swallowed up with affliction'', ''After so many misfortunes,
  it only remains for me to die''.

  Then, select phrases for when one chances upon Michael Howard: ''His babbling absolutely
  splits my head'', ''There is something repulsive in his address'', ''It is difficult
  for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me'', ''Has he sworn to tease
  us all day?''

  When training for a post in the Diplomatic Service, there''s the useful section
  headed ''of age and the different periods of life'': ''Your aunt appears very aged'',
  ''His brother, who is younger than he, is quite decrepit'', ''He is in a state of
  extreme decay'', ''He already has one foot in the grave''

  And, of course, these random phrases which might come in useful among friends: ''What
  a quantity of asparagus and artichokes!'' ''My eldest sister had the whooping-cough,
  the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother the small-pox, and the youngest
  a miliary fever'', ''Shall I help you to undress?'', ''I will take charge of the
  bread and butter''.

  Splendid stuff from Max, as ever. Even more correspondence tomorrow.


  ALL EARS

  It''s an extraordinarily long time since we last had a Hooting Yard playlist, way
  back on 7th October 2004 in fact. How time flies. Here, then, are ten pieces of
  music that you might well hear if you happen to be wandering past the serried belvederes
  of Haemoglobin Towers. In alphabetical order by title:

  Elegie for cello & piano--Gabriel Faure

  El Pueblo Unido Jamas Cera Vencido--Quilapayun

  Four Last Songs--Richard Strauss

  Fruits Of My Labour--Lucinda Williams

  Get Up--Sleater-Kinney

  Lakes Of Pontchartrain--The Be Good Tanyas

  Noye''s Fludd--Benjamin Britten

  The Light Pours Out Of Me--Magazine

  The Unborn Byron--Slapp Happy

  Tow-Truck--Picastro

  And a special mention must go to an eleventh piece, if only for the title:

  Grim And Frostbitten Gay Bar--Impaled Northern Moonforest


  DISPATCHES FROM THE NIB OF VAN DONGELBRAACKE

  Lo! In that year of torrential rainfall and storm clouds I set out from the city
  carrying with me nought but a few rags. I saw cows grazing, I heard horses whinnying.
  At the edges of farmyards I hid behind hedges. My appearance was not one to encourage
  some cherry-cheeked farmer''s wife to invite me in for a dish of scrambled eggs.
  For days on end I ate nothing but berries, or scraps of leftover cake from countryside
  wedding parties abandoned in panic after visitations from extraterrestrial beings
  dressed up in glistening metallic space-clothing and armed with laser guns. Everywhere
  I went I saw evidence of burned-out barnyards and terrified geese. After roaming
  aimlessly for about three months, I came to a city by the sea. I sat on a milestone
  and gazed at the unfamiliar skyline. Some of the masts of ships docked in the harbour
  were taller than the buildings. I fed a handful of crumbs to the goose that had
  been accompanying me for the last few days, and patted its eternally bobbing head.
  "Let us march into that city and be bold!" I announced to the goose, pointlessly,
  for it did not understand a word of human language, being a goose. Nevertheless,
  it followed me as I hoisted my bag of rags on to my back and strode towards the
  customs post on the edge of the city. The weather was still tempestuous. I cannot
  count the number of puddles I squelched through, nor how many squalls set that little
  goose a-jitter. The customs post, when at last we lumbered up to it, was deserted,
  but for a man of great illness lying sprawled on a pallet, whose moans took only
  moments to irritate me. Indeed, the sound of human whining, after months of solitude,
  set my teeth on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle him as best it
  could. The goose sat on the sick man''s head while I rifled through the filing cabinets.
  It was at this precise moment that the press photographer bounded through the door
  and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar to you. Startled by camera flashes,
  the goose fled. I backed against the wall, ragged and, I must confess, wild-eyed.
  The sick man was transmogrified. Only now did I become aware of his police uniform,
  as he and the photographer exchanged a glance that conveyed some terrible significance.
  That is why I am writing to you from a prison cell. Thus far I have fed my interrogators
  a pack of lies, but I do not know how much longer I can hold out. Please, please,
  my darling, try as best you can to smuggle in a package of sellotape, soap, bleach,
  some pins, a map and a bale of plastic sheeting so that I can make good my escape!

  HOW TO THINK OF THINGS OTHER THAN JUGGLING

  This is a splendid exercise first developed by brain guru Dennis Beerpint, brother
  of the poet Gervase Beerpint (see 3rd February). Go to a field. Attaching clamps
  to slats with quarter-inch gulliver bolts, smear some lattice-work with a decoction
  of binding-agents and thread the netting through tin clips, then dislodge the hasp
  on the paddle in order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges, which should
  be arranged in rotation beside colour-coded pails, the white one being strapped
  to a clogged bracket, the red one spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held
  in place by rubber frets, and the black one chiming against the aluminium knob on
  the wicket, which is fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled
  by a clay handle on the bole, against which pellets are fired at pre-arranged intervals
  by the steam gun just below the fourth set of nozzles, cleverly positioned at such
  a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases to pass
  over the tarpaulin, in which punctures have been made to allow ease of passage for
  the andiron tubes carrying ballbearings to the spandrel and thus on to the rotating
  wooden platform, upon which the greased hinges chafe against the pulleys sufficiently
  for the sparks to ignite sulphur bombs inside the bakelite carriage, without endangering
  the pads, bulbs and chocks on the hooter, at the sounding of which the intricately-wired
  snares snap shut and entrap the oiled plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting
  the recurrent biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of todge
  into the motor around which you will have placed canvas bags packed with candles
  in order to steady the persistent rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron
  sledge underneath the trolley carrying the double battery-powered hammer which serves
  to agitate the drum containing the four-inch blades detached from the rusted bowl
  of the compass, held in place on the rocket by a monstrous titanium screw wedged
  against the plackets of the grit distributor, customised by locking its gut probes
  into position with no less than twenty six separate multiple-gate plugs, on each
  of which a scorched zinc disc swivels in response to the magnetic properties of
  the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out
  of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains
  which run parallel to the lengths of string tied at one end to the pirate''s aureole
  and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags stolen from
  the same warehouse which provided the hooks for the plank balanced uneasily across
  the gap between the pinboard and the hodometer fitted with small beeswax parcels
  lashed to the crane from which dangle several springs and coils loaded with lead
  weights and enamelled cubes the purpose of which becomes apparent when the gleaming
  cork is plunged into the canister of boiling duckpond water kept at constant temperature
  by hastily-repaired piping fed by siphons and buttressed by giant prongs from the
  surfaces of which have been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the use
  of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the derrick next to the pumps on
  the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material
  as a sop to the git who provided the jars, flakes and asbestos-free wing cranks
  you will require for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism
  moulded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged from a manufacturer of resins whose
  grotesque sponge hood has been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium
  tripod atop which lurks a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic
  pan containing phosphorus hoops and a glamorous leather trumpet pitched towards
  a cobalt beaker lit up by the Mackenzie Beam angled obliquely next to a yellow fustian
  canopy covering a massive trellis to which are glued an up-ended cone of polythene
  veiled by cotton-wool wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller caked in mercury
  powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub countersunk behind the crust
  of a feather on a stool with pins affixed to the leaching grille placed askew atop
  the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Now stand back and count to a hundred.
  You will have forgotten all about juggling.


  "THE KAM, AS IF APPROACHING THE YARTA..."

  "The kam, as if approaching the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence, bows,
  brings his drum up to his forehead, and says, ''Mergu! mergu!'' Then he declares
  whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts; this is meant to indicate that Erlik
  is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his yurta. The frightened kam leaps
  backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Erlik''s
  throne. After this performance has been gone through three times, Erlik speaks:
  ''Winged creatures cannot fly hither, beings with bones cannot come: how have you,
  ill-smelling black beetle, made your way to my abode?''" -- M. A. Czaplicka, Shamanism
  In Siberia'
