full_text: 'NINE YEARS AGO (AGAIN)

  There seem to be a few vaporous stirrings within the Key head, so it is not entirely
  vacant. Those stirrings may yet lead to some sweeping pargraphs of majestic prose.
  Meanwhile, here is a piece that first appeared on this day nine years ago:

  Devoted readers of Hooting Yard--are there any other kind?--know that we do our
  utmost to bring you the very, very best in modern, cutting-edge soup recipes. As
  part of the latest tranche, here is a marvellous example, provided by Dr Ruth Pastry''s
  sister Maud:

  Ingredients: 1 lb each of apricots, breadcrumbs, coleslaw, dandelions, edelweiss
  stalks, flapjacks and goldfish brains; 6 tbsp honey; 2 oz isinglass; 1 lb each of
  jackdaw feathers, ketchup, love-lies-bleeding, marmalade, nougat and oxlips; 1 pea;
  1 tub quicklime; 4 oz each of raisins*, spikenard and toffee; 15 tsp unspeakable
  goo; 1 family-size catering pack of vinegar; 3 whelks; as much xanthium as you can
  stomach; 12 pkts yeast; 44 zinnias.

  Method: Pound everything beginning with a vowel into a mulch. Smear it on to the
  inside of a big bowl. Put the bowl somewhere safe and below freezing point for a
  week. Cut everything else up into chunks the size of a newborn baby''s fist, then
  chargrill. Go and get the bowl and toss the chunks in haphazardly. Place the bowl
  under an outside spigot and fill to the brim with water. Leave to stand for as long
  as you like, depending on how hungry you are. Transfer to a cauldron. Bring to the
  boil and allow to simmer. Pour in some milk. Re-boil, indefatigably. Ladle off the
  scum from the top. Serve with hibiscus clumps and cocoa.

  * NOTE : The mention of raisins in Maud Pastry''s recipe prompts me to quote this
  splendid passage from Francis Wheen''s How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered The World (Fourth
  Estate):

  If [Islamic fundamentalist suicide-bombers] die in the struggle, so much the better--since
  they will be welcomed into paradise by seventy-two virgins, ready to satisfy every
  sensual need. (This titillating inducement may not be all it seems. A scholarly
  new Koranic study by Christoph Luxenberg suggests that the legend of the virgins
  is based on a misinterpretation of the word hur, which translates from Arabic as
  ''houris'' but in the Syriac language meant ''white raisins''. Imagine the disappointment
  of a suicide-bomber who arrives in heaven expecting a bevy of gorgeous maidens,
  ''chaste as hidden pearls'', only to be offered a bowl of dried grapes instead.)


  SOUP ANNIVERSARY

  Today, unbelievably, we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Hooting Yard Soup
  Committee. That is to say, it is precisely ten years ago today that this piece,
  entitled Soup Committee, first appeared at Hooting Yard:

  Dobson rarely sought collaborators in his pamphleteering work, preferring to plough
  his furrow alone. Occasionally, however, his schemes were so ambitious that it was
  necessary to call in help. One such plan led to the formation of what became known
  as the Soup Committee.

  Dobson woke up one wintry morning with an idea in his head. This was not uncommon,
  but usually his ideas could be--and were--dashed off in a brief pamphlet. Not so
  the gigantic multi-volume work he pictured in his mind, a compendium of every known
  soup recipe ever conceived, throughout human history, from the dawn of time to today''s
  date, across all cultures and civilisations. Even Dobson realised that he could
  not accomplish so mighty a project single-handed, so he asked Marigold Chew to draw
  up a list of likely contributors. The Soup Committee was her idea. Reasoning that
  if she invited people to take part in a Dobson plan they would probably decline,
  and thus shatter the pamphleteer''s already shattered nerves, she used her usual
  hardline tactics. The letter she sent out to over eight hundred unsuspecting souls
  is preserved in the Dobson Archive.

  Dear Soup Person, it read, This is to inform you that you have been empanelled on
  to the Soup Committee. Your empanelment is effective from today''s date and remains
  in force until such time as you die. The full implications of your membership of
  the Committee will follow by separate post, but you had better start gathering soup
  recipes right now. Yours decisively, Marigold Chew, pp Dobson.

  The pamphleteer himself decided to begin by garnering soup recipes from the Old
  and New Testaments, and set about rereading his Bible with pencil and notepad in
  hand. He was distraught, at the end of this exercise, to discover that the word
  "soup" appears nowhere in the Authorised Version, or King James Bible, which was
  the edition he swore by. He went back to the beginning and realised that "pottage"
  was possibly a synonym for "soup", although it might also mean what we know as "stew".
  Undeterred, Dobson was able to fill a couple of pages of his notepad.

  In Genesis 25, for example, we have, 29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from
  the field, and he was faint, 30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with
  that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom, and 34
  Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and
  rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. This is elsewhere
  translated as And Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, of course, a resounding
  phrase we would all do well to remember.

  Moving on to the second book of Kings, chapter four, after having soup for lunch,
  Dobson read 38 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land;
  and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant,
  Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets, 39 And one
  went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof
  wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they
  knew them not, and finally 40 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came
  to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou
  man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.

  Towards the end of the Old Testament, Dobson found one last mention of soup, or
  stew, in Haggai 2: 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
  his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be
  holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

  Seven verses, but presumably only three different soups, the most interesting to
  Dobson being the one in Kings which has "death in the pot". What was this poisonous
  potion? We know that Dobson was a vain, even arrogant pamphleteer, but he did have
  some small shred of humility. He recognised that if his great work on soup was to
  be definitive, every single recipe would have to be authorised by an expert. Marigold
  Chew sent a second letter to the members of the Committee.

  Dear Empanelled Soup Committee Person, she wrote, As a matter of urgency, further
  detail is required on the wild gourds which were shredded into the pottage mentioned
  in 2 Kings 4:39, as well as the ingredients already in the pot, which, as you know,
  contained death. Send your reply by courier. Yours tenaciously, Marigold Chew, pp
  Dobson.

  Not a single one of the recipients ever replied. Dobson himself soon lost interest
  in soup recipes, filed his notes away, and embarked that very same winter on a series
  of pamphlets about sodium, postage stamps, the manufacture of church bells, loosely-fitting
  cardigans, gutta percha price fluctuations and Plovdiv. One by one, over the years,
  the Soup Committee members died out. It is thought that only three of them are still
  alive, one in Bastwick, one in Cleves, and one, now 104 years old, fit as a fiddle,
  plying a ferry across an inlet at an unidentified seaside resort battered by gales,
  battered by storms, battered by gales, battered.


  POLITICAL ANIMALS

  It is always worth keeping an eye on Hansard, the official record of parliamentary
  debates. Every so often, among all the blather, there is a spot of illumination.
  Here, for example, is an exchange from yesterday:

  Mr. John Randall (Uxbridge) (Con): The Minister claimed that the Labour Government
  have been good for birds. What are their plans for cormorants?

  Mr. Bradshaw: Cormorants are one of the species that have done extremely well in
  the past twenty years... even if the maximum number of licences were issued, the
  cormorant population would still be far higher than it was under the Tories.

  The idea that enfranchised cormorants and other birds would be natural Labour voters
  reminds me of a long-ago comment in the house journal of countryside bloodlust,
  The Field: "If foxes could hear all sides in the debate on hunting, I think they
  would vote solidly for its continuance." A similar sentiment was expressed in a
  letter to the Sussex Express & County Herald: "I am convinced that if a fox could
  vote, he would vote Conservative."


  PONTIFF!

  Max Decharne writes from Berlin to note that the Daily Mail is reviving the high
  standard of tabloid newspaper headlines. On Monday I quoted their Gasping Pope Minutes
  From Death. "I wish I had a framed copy of the front page on my wall," writes Max,
  "It reminds me of those early eighties headlines which got used as punk song titles
  by the likes of The Exploited. City Baby Attacked By Rats is one I remember well."
  To which, of course, should be added the immortal Must We Fling This Filth At Our
  Pop Kids?

  Max goes on to remind us of the winning ways of an earlier pontiff, Eugenio Pacelli,
  alias Pius XII. "I recommend John Cornwell''s fascinating Hitler''s Pope--The Secret
  History of Pius XII. Signor Pacelli seems to have been a humble chap. He ordered
  that anyone in the clergy who was on the other end of the telephone to him should
  kneel throughout the conversation, and the gardeners in his private garden were
  instructed to hide in the bushes as he went past, so he wouldn''t have to look at
  them. Having, of course, sworn an oath of poverty, he drove around in a huge limousine
  with no chairs in the back, just a large throne. He also seems to have regarded
  himself as an expert on all manner of subjects. Here is Cornwell:

  "If he showed signs of grandiosity it was in his tendency to expatiate on an ever
  expanding range of topics. So numerous and so beyond his competence were these specialised
  talks, or ''allocutions'', that the practice seemed symptomatic of ripening delusions
  of omniscience. He lectured visiting groups on subjects such as dentistry, gymnastics,
  gynaecology, aeronautics, cinematography, psychology, psychiatry, agriculture, plastic
  surgery, and the art of newscasting. A visitor to his study once remarked on the
  piles of fat manuals around his desk; Pacelli responded that he was preparing a
  talk on gas central heating. When T S Eliot, arguably the leading English-language
  poet and literary critic of his day, came to the Vatican for a private audience
  in 1948, Pacelli delivered him a lecture on literature."

  All of which makes me realise that the late Anthony Burgess would have made an absolutely
  terrific Pope.


  Pius XII''s soutane and Anthony Burgess, who ought to have worn one like it


  ABOUT ENCHATONS

  In today''s lecture we shall attend to both enchatons and enchaton-stubs, in their
  quiddity and morass. Floripad wrote that "in the collapsing is the appentiture",
  and those words, hidden away in a footnote, yet ring down the ages. I gasp, you
  gasp, he, she or it gasps. Much gasping and not a little panting. We gasp, you plural
  gasp, they gasp. That is what happens when we try to extricate Floripad from the
  entangled porcupine of the past, and it is fair to say that it must be so when we
  take account of the duty imposed upon us by our collegiate panjandrums to sequester
  what is mad from what is made, that which is made in the brain or with the counted
  limbs.

  Consider for a moment a wild hog. Irksome as it can be to propel one''s mind towards
  the twinkling stars of the incumbency of henmemet beings, it must be done with grace
  and an attunement to planetary winds. Floripad himself says, in Conditions With
  Slots, "being as grit, doing as a pearl", and it is well to remember that in the
  teeth of reverie.

  Let us recollect the technique. The bath of tin and fumigatory salts, the enshadowing
  of the tapped, and the experimental conquest of untenable tensors, three zinc, three
  tungsten, five copper, each tensor placed over a retort, and the fires belching
  grandly. Herein the daring of monsters. Do not forget the bitumen.

  As people have made necklaces from bones, teeth, and feathers, so today we must
  devise new forms in our underground laboratories. Floripad himself speaks of "the
  mortgage of snow blindness". Tarleton had booster packs. Science does not rest.

  Enchatons of the rubber basin, doused in caustic soda, and then burned. In their
  burning, unexpected petrochemical advowsons entrained within a cuddy. The helmet
  and the patent on the prong, made to measure and in the sky. You may recall the
  shock that greeted proof copies of Temeraire: The Propulsion, that flimsy pamphlet
  so widely read by movers and shakers. In hock to those who gather cowslips, the
  resonance of tumbling hobbyhorses, etched on a pane, unjoined dots, fantastic spoor
  of Mazeppa, De Looth and Bannion, to name but three.

  From sand comes not-sand, from the planet-metal affinities the lore of the barb
  and the barbel. West or east, hands across some mental ocean tied in time and tucked
  in folds that mimic the integuments of a grosser dispensation. That is what we work
  for. That is why we work. That is why, one by one, we see each pinprick star brilliant
  in the ether, our horses unsaddled, our buckles valiant, our dust no longer dust.
  Goodnight.


  TINY ENID EXTINGUISHES A VOLCANO

  One windy September morning, Tiny Enid read in her daily newspaper that a big volcano
  might be about to erupt. Vulcanology was not her strong point, but some of the comments
  quoted in the story made her sit up with a start. A number of scientists from organisations
  with befuddling acronyms said things like: "It looks like it will erupt soon," and
  "We have recorded volcanic activity". Tiny Enid scoured the paper to see if there
  were any other signs or portents, such as unusual locust-swarm formations, but there
  were none. Yet.

  Her mind was made up. She packed a bag with pitons, hammers, extra socks, and a
  flask of her secret elixir. She left instructions for the milk delivery person and
  the topiarist, and called a taxi. The taxi took her from her house to the railway
  station, where she boarded a train to the port, from where a small boat rounded
  the coastline to that part of the land where there was an airfield. Tiny Enid had
  allowed her pilot''s licence to expire, so she paid a man with a decisive moustache
  and a flying cap to take the controls of the little two-seater Pangloss diesel plane,
  and flew into the wild blue yonder with gritted teeth and blazing eyes. Tiny Enid
  never wore goggles when flying. She thought them a sign of moral dereliction.


  Thomas a Kempis

  Tiny Enid never let a day pass without reading a few pages of The Imitation Of Christ
  by Thomas a Kempis. Indeed, she kept a ragged copy of this devotional classic in
  her bag at all times. It is true that the Augustinian monk has nothing to say on
  the subject of flying goggles, given that he was writing in the 1420s, and it is
  hard for us to comprehend how Tiny Enid arrived at her interpretation. It is hard,
  and also unwise, for no less than a dozen harmless souls have gone crackers trying
  to correlate the contents of Tiny Enid''s brain. They languish now in places of
  shuddery languishment, although it is to Tiny Enid''s credit that she pays for their
  keep, including porridge for breakfast and a nurse who mops their brows. Thomas
  a Kempis suggests (Chapter 50) that "the desolate man should place himself in God''s
  hands", and Tiny Enid agrees, but she has too a sense of her responsibility. Although
  these twelve men tried to make sense of her cerebral fumes and vapours uninvited,
  that does not stop her doing what she can for them.

  When the Pangloss landed at the foot of the volcano, Tiny Enid clambered out. She
  put on her extra socks and ascended the volcano using her pitons and hammers. When
  she reached the summit, she found a pair of perilous vents in which molten magma
  was bubbling and boiling, ready to erupt, just like the scientists had said. She
  also saw a great deal of tephra, in the form of rocks and cinders, ashes and dust,
  as if there had already been a mini-eruption. Pausing only to scan the sky for birds,
  Tiny Enid extinguished the volcano using a technique she had read about in the Reader''s
  Digest. Then she started on the long journey home, whistling, and only a little
  muddy.


  TOTAL ECLIPSE

  One day, after a huge breakfast, Ignapfando had a total eclipse of the heart, just
  like that songstress whose name escapes me. He did not look as if it was happening.
  Indeed to the untrained eye Ignapfando looked as if he was asleep, rather than in
  the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident rock music. Adding
  to the disjuncture was the fact that Ignapfando resembled Clement Attlee, down to
  the finicky moustache and an inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless, when he went
  to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be no doubt about
  the upheavals of his passion.

  "Bless me father for I have sinned," he pleaded as he knelt facing the grille behind
  which the priest sat clutching his rosary beads and wishing he was Montgomery Clift
  in I Confess. "I have had a total eclipse of the heart."

  "Let me stop you there, my child," murmured the priest, "I have heard enough. Say
  three Our Fathers, four Hail Marys, and one An Evil Cradling by Brian Keenan. Now
  get you gone."

  Ignapfando left the confessional. Soon afterwards, so did the priest, his own heart
  not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black sins he had
  had to listen to all morning. Terrible, terrible sins, of impiety and vainglory
  and greed, of abandonment and lust, of twiddly Moog synthesiser solos, rapine, pillage
  and wrack. He imagined each sin as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them all into
  a sack. It was a burlap sack, tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it onto his back.
  His back was broad, and his shoulders were strong, and he carried the sack through
  all the day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart, and at nightfall he tossed
  it onto a cart. He reined up his horse in the milky moon''s glow, and off he rode
  with the sack on the cart. Ignapfando tossed and turned in his attic of sin with
  his total eclipse of the heart.

  Dawn came. Ignapfando awoke refreshed, all sin washed away, a man who now was pure.
  Far, far away on the road to the lime kilns, the priest with his horse and cart
  and sack full of sin had stopped to drink water from a stream. It was a pretty rill.
  As if in a dream, the songstress appeared, standing in the long grass, dressed in
  no longer fashionable glam finery. There was a sudden din. Was it the music of the
  spheres as conceived in the Mind of Brian May? The priest clapped his hands over
  his ears, his horse reared up in terror, and the burlap sack exploded, its incandescence
  vapourising the sun, the blast almost as loud as the songstress and her band, belting
  out her anthem.

  This much have I seen. This much have I heard.'
