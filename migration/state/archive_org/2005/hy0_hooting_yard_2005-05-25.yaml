full_text: 'NINE YEARS AGO

  I am afraid the Key head is an entirely empty thing at the moment. So here, to keep
  you entertained, is a piece that appeared nine years ago today, on 3 April 2004,
  though it was written--and published as a pamphlet--long long ago in the last decade
  of the previous century. It is entitled Sidney The Bat Is Awarded The Order Of Lenin.

  Like many bats, Sidney spent much of his time hanging upside down in a dark, damp
  cave. Both of his parents were still alive, and on Saturdays he would visit them.
  They lived in the attic of a museum, and enjoyed swooping, wings aflutter, around
  the heads of any museum employees who came up to the attic, which was used as a
  clutter-strewn storage area. The museum housed collections of electromagnetic apparatus,
  galvanometers, and cast iron mesmeric engines. It was the most renowned museum of
  its kind in the land, numbering among its exhibits not only Von Ick''s Patent Trance
  Mechanism but also an archive of papers from the laboratory of the great celery
  scientist Kapisko.

  Professor Maud Dweb was the chief curator. Her in-tray was piled high with complaints
  about the bats in the attic. One young assistant janitor, on his first ever visit
  up there, had been literally frightened out of his wits. He had been removed to
  a sanatorium in remote mountainous country, and his family, despite most of them
  being brain-addled, had made known their intentions to prosecute the museum. One
  of the land''s most relentless lawyers had been paid a retainer. Professor Dweb
  decided to act.

  One Saturday evening, after the museum had closed, when soon the full moon [would]
  swim up over the edge of the world and hang like a great golden cheese (in the words
  attributed to the shade of Oscar Wilde by the spirit medium Hester Travers Smith),
  the curator ascended the staircase to the gloomy attic. It was the work of minutes
  to set a number of bat-traps in the darkness. As she made to leave, Professor Dweb
  stumbled over a crate containing the world''s only surviving example of Bickering''s
  Superb New Hinge, banged her head on the wall, and dropped to the floor, unconscious.
  Sidney''s parents swooped low, and perched--do bats perch?--on her back.

  At that very moment, Sidney flapped in through the skylight. He and his parents
  exchanged greetings, in bat-language. They told him what had happened to Professor
  Dweb, who was sinking into a catatonic stupor. Sidney was most disappointed, for
  he could not see any fun in flapping around someone who was unconscious. She wouldn''t
  be scared at all! He resolved to arouse the curator, and at once began to make hideous
  bat-like squealing noises directly into her ear, flicking his wings against her
  temples. It took some time, but eventually Maud Dweb woke with a start. Then she
  screeched, flailing her arms at the mischievous bat. She fled the attic, slamming
  the trap-door behind her, leaving the fiendish bat-traps to do their work.

  An hour later she was back in the attic, armed with a torch. She found Sidney hanging
  upside down from the rafters. "Well, young bat," she announced, "Inadvertently,
  you have performed a great service to your country! Had you not woken me from my
  stupor, thieves would have made off with the museum''s most prized exhibit! I was
  only just in time to nab them! Fleeing from you, I went downstairs to find a pair
  of counter-revolutionary ne''er-do-wells about to make off with Darjeeling''s Anti-Imperialist
  Galvanising Motor! You are--as a mere bat--probably unaware that this machine is
  a potent symbol of our glorious revolution. I shall recommend to the General Secretary
  of the Party that you are given an award in recognition of your deed. Well done!"

  Sidney''s parents patted him proudly on his bat-head. Professor Dweb dismantled
  the bat-traps. The full moon shimmered through the skylight.


  MAX

  Continuing with correspondence received during Hooting Yard''s break, the estimable
  Max Decharne sent this:

  Some years back I bought an old book called New Familiar and Progressive English
  and French Dialogues (With Dialogues on Railway and Steamboat Travelling, and a
  Comparative Table of Monies and Measure) by Richard and Quetin, published by Hachette,
  1876, which I was recently looking through again, and it remains one of the finest
  phrase books I''ve ever encountered.

  Some of it sounds like the dialogue from a porn film: ''You oblige me in so willing
  a manner, that it encourages me to apply to you again and again'', ''I am delighted
  that you make use of me so freely'', ''You may dispose of me as you will'', ''It
  is impossible to do a favour in a more pleasing manner'' ''I have never experienced
  such satisfaction'', ''I believe I shall go mad with pleasure''.

  Then there''s the section entitled ''To express horror and fright'': ''It is abominable,
  horrid, infamous'', ''It is violating all that is most sacred in nature'', ''It
  is enough to freeze one''s blood with horror'', ''There never was anything seen
  so abominable'', ''The mind revolts from the idea of such a crime''.

  Or perhaps, when visiting those tourist spots in Paris, and one feels the need to
  ''express dipleasure and grief'': ''I am ruined beyond remedy'', ''My misfortunes
  are at their height'', ''I am swallowed up with affliction'', ''After so many misfortunes,
  it only remains for me to die''.

  Then, select phrases for when one chances upon Michael Howard: ''His babbling absolutely
  splits my head'', ''There is something repulsive in his address'', ''It is difficult
  for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me'', ''Has he sworn to tease
  us all day?''

  When training for a post in the Diplomatic Service, there''s the useful section
  headed ''of age and the different periods of life'': ''Your aunt appears very aged'',
  ''His brother, who is younger than he, is quite decrepit'', ''He is in a state of
  extreme decay'', ''He already has one foot in the grave''

  And, of course, these random phrases which might come in useful among friends: ''What
  a quantity of asparagus and artichokes!'' ''My eldest sister had the whooping-cough,
  the youngest had the measles, my eldest brother the small-pox, and the youngest
  a miliary fever'', ''Shall I help you to undress?'', ''I will take charge of the
  bread and butter''.

  Splendid stuff from Max, as ever. Even more correspondence tomorrow.


  RULES OF THE GAME

  Little is known of the origins of football, a game which is today one of the most
  popular sports throughout the Northern Lands. According to De Smet [see The Punnet,
  Vol XVI No.9], football began when tribal elders in the hinterland around Hoon took
  to mucking about after the annual ritual ostrich-battering. Thumper, on the other
  hand, has argued in a number of persuasive essays that the sordid practices of a
  family living in a cave near Bodger''s Spinney were the true origins of the game.
  Either of these theories may be true, as might thousands upon thousands of others.
  But let us not tarry in the past.

  The rules of football are stupendously complex. The rubric itself fills hundreds
  of huge volumes, and interpretative texts, analyses and commentaries have accumulated
  at such a rate that entire libraries are now devoted to the subject. That being
  the case, it is impractical in this essay to do more than sketch the merest outline.
  So let us draw breath, take stock, make a cup of tea, twang a ukulele, skip frolicsome
  thro'' ling and heather, rap curses at hunched louts, sprinkle talc upon our scalps,
  whisk an egg, brush our teeth, impale a mothball, crack a biscuit, mumble a homily,
  tie a ship''s knot in a necklace, stoke up the fire, spit on the coals, irk a butcher,
  crick our necks, stamp on a bee, shovel grit outside the police station, howl at
  the Wergo, mitigate a plea, fold a crocus, employ a grotesquerie and put a flea
  in its ear: come follow me as I expound the laws of football.

  There are two teams of thirty one players each, plus a moderator, two assistant
  moderators, a plinth sergeant, a brazil nut attendant, and a person holding a tape
  measure. The teams are dubbed "Bark" and "Sap": these terms are as arbitrary as
  the use of white and black to differentiate chess pieces, or the pigs and cones
  used in the game of lanternjaw. Each team consists of ten jack hulberts, ten cicely
  courtneidges, six badgers, a winch, a hurdle, a cake, a denial, and a pond. Only
  two badgers may be fielded at one time, unless the winch is out of play. Players
  may make use of bats, sticks, hooked poles, claw-hammers, lances, ballbearings,
  fenceposts, swords, bayonets, doorhandles, fireworks and icing sugar. At the beginning
  of play the moderator tosses on to the rink three balls: one is of leather, one
  of bladder, and one of zinc. Surprisingly, the rules say nothing about the size
  of the balls, and there is great variation among those commonly in use.

  The object of the game is for the Bark team to puncture the leather and bladder
  balls beyond repair and to hide the zinc ball for a period of twenty three hours,
  while the Sap team must try to protect all three balls by putting them in wicker
  containers and keeping the opposing side away from them for an identical period.
  The field of play is called the pitch, rink, arena, clat, ford, or basin. It is
  marked out with an intricate tangle of signs and symbols and is usually waterlogged.

  A true appreciation of football is hampered by the difficulty of understanding the
  subsidiary objectives--or "planks" -- of the game. Either of the assistant moderators
  may impose planks at the start of the game or in the intervals between fits. There
  is an enormous list of planks in the rule-books from which selections may be made.
  A brief sample here can do no more than suggest an idea of the subtlety of thought
  which has developed in this aspect of football over the years. Taken literally at
  random, the list of planks includes the following: digging a trench across the rink;
  sawing off the handles of the opposing team''s swords; planning, preparing, cooking,
  serving and eating a gala pie; synchronised palpitation; instilling an overwhelming
  sense of wistfulness in one''s team-mates; dismantling the wicket; holding an accordion
  contest.

  Penalties for foul play are vicious, arbitrary and senseless. Only the moderator
  and the plinth sergeant are permitted to impose penalties, and they must consult
  with each other, using an intricate system of hand signals, before the penalty can
  be implemented. Please do not be given the impression that there is any element
  of violence in the penalties. Their viciousness, arbitrariness and senselessness
  are of a much higher order, inconceivable to those who have not themselves played
  the game.

  The kit, or strip, is of admirable simplicity. The Sap team appears naked, with
  the small concession to modesty of skin-tight, flesh-coloured tunics. (In this case,
  flesh-coloured means precisely what it says. The garments are dyed to the exact
  shade of the individual player''s skin by experts retained by the Football Association.)
  The Bark team, on the other hand, is kitted out in voluminous clothing suitable
  for an Antarctic expedition--all furs, hides and swaddling, with plenty of pockets,
  pouches, flaps, zips, buttons, toggles, belts and buckles. As the game is played
  throughout the year, the Sap team has a natural advantage in the summer months,
  while the Bark team will tend to perform better in the biting chill of winter.

  But enough of these confounded rules! As it is, they are elastic, very elastic.
  So much depends upon the temperament of the brazil nut attendant, in whose hands
  the very nature of the game can be transformed, to the extent that the rules I have
  so patiently explained would be unrecognisable to you, dear reader. The commentaries
  on the role of this official are abstruse and profound, and are deserving of years
  and years of study. Bagshaw and Taplow, in their invaluable tome The Brazil Nut
  Attendant : Retribution & Paralysis, have come closest to providing a manageable
  overview of the topic, although their tendency to refer to the game as "socker"
  is regrettable.

  Before bringing this essay to a sprightly close, it will be helpful to give the
  reader some idea of the game''s organisation, particularly in the professional sphere.
  The two chief administrative bodies are the Football Association and the Football
  League. The former is a severe and monolithic body which ensures that the rules
  of the game are adhered to by all parties at all times. It has a staff of over eight
  hundred scriveners, clerks and lackeys who work by the light of just four Tilly
  lamps. These saintly men and women spend their working lives issuing lengthy directives
  couched in a language so mesmeric that the recipients throw them at once into the
  dustbin without even trying to wring any sense out of them. This cavalier attitude
  has its repercussions, of course. From time to time, the Association sends out Special
  Inspectors, highly-trained gits plucked from sinks of corruption, with murder in
  their hearts and blackjacks in their fists. No football club visited by a Special
  Inspector has ever dared transgress the rules again. The Association holds an annual
  competition, the winning team of which is awarded the Fred Jesson Cup, named after
  Laura''s husband in the film Brief Encounter. The cup is a model of a pollarded
  willow made out of battered tin. Birdhole''s mighty six-volume From Custard To Wooziness
  provides a splendid history of the contest, and bravely addresses the more arcane
  aspects of the marking system, contemplation of which has led countless devotees
  to a sordid, drink-sodden demise.

  Of the Football League, however, there is nothing remotely interesting to be said.


  PANSY THE ADEPT

  Here, for your edification and instruction, is a translation of the War Song of
  the Huitznahuac, taken from Rig Veda Americanus, Sacred Songs of the Ancient Mexicans,
  number eight in Brinton''s Library of Aboriginal American Literature, edited by
  D G Brinton (1890):

  1. What ho! my work is in the hall of arms, I listen to no mortal, nor can any put
  me to shame, I know none such, I am the Terror, I know none other, I am where war
  is, my work is said to be in the hall of arms, let no one curse my children.

  2. Our adornment comes from out the south, it is varied in colour as the clothing
  of the eagle.

  3. Ho! ho! abundance of youths doubly clothed, arrayed in feathers, are my captives,
  I deliver them up, I deliver them up, my captives arrayed in feathers.

  4. Ho! youths for the Huitznahuac, arrayed in feathers, these are my captives, I
  deliver them up, I deliver them up, arrayed in feathers, my captives.

  5. Youths from the south, arrayed in feathers, my captives, I deliver them up, I
  deliver them up, arrayed in feathers, my captives.

  6. The god enters, the Huitznahuac, he descends as an example, he shines forth,
  he shines forth, descending as an example.

  7. Adorned like us he enters as a god, he descends as an example, he shines forth,
  he shines forth, descending as an example.

  An adaptation of this song, with slightly amended words, wassailed to the tune of
  Carry On, Wayward Son by stadium rockers Kansas, has been heard around Hooting Yard
  every day for the past couple of months, ever since Pansy Cradledew became an Adept
  of Goon Fang. Often confused with the traditional martial arts of the East, Goon
  Fang is--as David Bowie once said so regrettably--"a completely different kettle
  of poisson". I asked Pansy to explain for readers what it means to be an Adept of
  this ancient mystic art. She scribbled a few words on the discarded wrapper of a
  toffee apple, as follows:

  It is not without reason that Goon Fang is shrouded in mystery, for when the powers
  of both Goon and Fang are combined, the Adept enters the Plane of VerEecke, a state
  of being both terrifying and a bit frightening. If I tell you anything more, my
  Goon energy will be dissipated and my Fang plasma will curdle. The plasma is of
  course invisible, and mighty, but should it curdle the very stars in their heavens
  will explode, so I am keeping mum for the time being.

  Pansy agreed, however, to share with us this photograph of a Goon Fang workshop
  held in a secret location:
