full_text: 'ANAXAGROTAX

  My name is Anaxagrotax, and I am the last survivor of a vanquished horde. Like the
  rest of my horde, I am neither an smooth man nor an hairy man, but somewhere in
  between. Our vanquishment was bloody and violent, as you might imagine. It was also
  very, very noisy, what with the clash of steel and the roar of cannonades and the
  howling and wailing of the wounded. I pray to my strange gods that never again will
  I witness such carnage.

  To my chagrin, it took only a single morning to vanquish my previously unconquerable
  horde. As dawn broke on that terrible Thursday, there were thousands of us, hooting
  and whooping, daubed in the Paint of Ferocity, sharpening our implements and grunting
  a lot. We were well fed, tough, fearless and bent on conquest. By noon I was the
  only one left, hiding in a patch of bracken, and, I confess, shuddering in terror
  and grief. I was also bleeding from a contusion on my forehead and possibly slightly
  concussed. All around me the moorland was a scene of corpses and hacked-off limbs
  and blood.

  By mid-afternoon I was feeling a little more myself. A stray hen had wandered into
  the bracken, and it was good to know that I was not the last living thing on earth.
  Poultry can be consoling in such circumstances. I reflected that as a warrior in
  a barbaric and bloodthirsty horde I ought to have expected things to turn out this
  way sooner or later. I was quite certain that our vanquishers had now left the scene
  to go and vanquish elsewhere, so I stood up and, saying goodbye to the hen, began
  walking away from my dead and, in some cases, still dying comrades in the direction
  of the palace. Perhaps it was callous of me to ignore the groans of those who were
  still alive, whose souls had not yet been plucked from their bodies by the hideous
  bat-faced god Beb and placed in his capacious pouch. Try not to judge me by your
  own moral code, if you have one.

  By nightfall I had reached the stream that runs into a pool near the palace. I sat
  down on a tuffet and lit a cigarette. The moon was full and there were so many stars
  visible that they set my brain dizzy. I looked across the fields at the palace.
  Reassuringly, the usual bonfire was blazing on the roof. A bold water rat came to
  give me the once over, but soon scuttled away. I stubbed out my cigarette and made
  my way towards the palace at last. Gusts of wind dishevelled my hairstyle despite
  all the grease I had caked it with that morning. It seemed so long, long ago. As
  I took my final weary steps towards the gigantic wooden gates, my heart leapt when
  I saw that a great golden banner had been hung from the crenellations. "Welcome
  Home, Anaxagrotax!" it read, in letters of vermilion and blue. As I beat my great
  muscular fists on the palace gates, midnight struck. Thursday was over.


  ON THE BONNY BONNY BANKS

  On the bonny bonny banks of the foul old loch, where a dredger plied from shore
  to shore, I saw my true love pluck some furze and place it in her hair. My true
  love was a wandering lass of a clan that herded cows, and she broke her back when
  she had a mishap with a trampoline. For her folk herded cows through the seasons
  long, but they also jumped and leaped. They would wander into the market square
  of a town down in some dale, and they''d bounce up and down and gambol about wearing
  coats of many hues. And the songs they sang! Oh, the songs they sang were as strange
  as strange could be. I remember one that went "Vienna--it means nothing to me".
  All caked and painted were their carts, yellow, green and blue. But my true love''s
  cart was black as pitch, as black as the raven and crow. I stand in the hills in
  an icy gale wondering where will my true love go? Green grow the rushes-oh, on those
  bonny bonny banks.


  PONTIFF MNEMONIC

  How vexing it is to be accosted by somebody who yells, "You there! Name all the
  Popes in order of their reign, beginning with the first and ending with the current
  incumbent!" As part of our tireless campaign to inform, elucidate, entertain, and

  Now, I know what you''re thinking. "How can I ever learn such a long list as that,
  me with my pea-sized brain?", you''re saying to yourself. Well, banish defeatism,
  reader! All you have to do is have a crack at this simple mnemonic. To make it even
  easier, there are many exclamation marks, adding that frisson of excitement which
  makes learning fun!

  just shampoo, but just black, sickening, baleful grease. Can beetles die? Lovely
  violet splendour. Nits and gnats. Vituperative uproar. Plangent grovelling. Check
  his impenetrable calculations! Let''s eat anchovies and asparagus! Let''s uproot
  gooseberries! Come, come, impudent hysterical git! Canned ink. Alternative ultraviolet

  pigs, pale, jabbering pigs, jabbering pigs, jabbering pigs!


  PALE FLAPPER : A LOVE STORY

  "What do you do with the drunken sailor?" is a question that has often been posed
  in the past. Never having been to sea, except once or twice, as a stowaway, it was
  not something Sidney Paste had given much thought to. Yet when he awoke on that
  still September morning, pale sunlight leaching into his scandalous fin de siecle
  bedroom, he was confronted by not one but a dozen drunken sailors, dancing a sort
  of hornpipe on his balconyette. It was dubbed a balconyette because it was considerably
  smaller than the average balcony in that fair city, so tiny in fact that it was
  a wonder that twelve drunken sailors had managed to cram themselves on to it, let
  alone to dance a sort of hornpipe.

  One of the sailors had an accordion, and was drunkenly squeezing out the tune to
  which they danced. Sidney Paste knew that tune well, for it was The Onion Song by
  Ashford and Simpson, memorably recorded by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell. Although,
  as we have seen, not given to pondering what he should do with the drunken sailor,
  Sidney Paste often thought about the fact that pain and fear are the spices that
  make you cry, for in his life he had known much pain and not a little fear. Was
  it fear of the drunken sailors that found him leaping from his bed now, on this
  September morn? Or was it that Sidney Paste always leapt straight out of bed as
  soon as he awoke, eager to seize the day, like some hyperactive toddler bent on
  gratification?

  Yes, that was it, for look at him now, filling the sink in his room with ice cold
  water and repeatedly plunging his head into it. But where is his towel? One of the
  drunken sailors has fashioned it into a piratical bandanna and wound it around his
  head to rein in his unruly locks, but his dancing of the sort of hornpipe is so
  vigorous that the towel is coming loose and within the next few seconds it will
  fall from his head and off the balconyette into the street so many storeys below,
  where it will land on a passing flapper on her way home from an all-night jitterbug
  party. In seeking to retrieve his towel, Sidney Paste will meet this pale and enchanting
  flapper, and what do you know, within the year they will be wed, and go honeymooning
  in the wild Arctic wastes of northern Canada, where they will befriend bears, commune
  with moose, and muck about like a lovestruck couple, smitten with bliss.


  THE BLOT FAMILY


  Shown above are the twenty six living members of the rather eerie Blot family. Ever
  since the night of the 1958 Munich Air Disaster, which wiped out the Busby Babes,
  the curiously ageless Blots have remained within the confines of the converted Pigsty
  Complex, just off the Blister Lane Bypass, where they forage for food, do meteorological
  readings, and ponderously intone ponderous incantations. Field recordings of the
  most ponderous of their incantations, the fourteen-hour Homage a Tippi Hedren, led
  to a mildly successful CD release. The Blot family are, left to right: Ajax, Blackguard,
  Cutty, Dismay, Elkan, Fod, Gazeppa, Histamine, Insurgent, Jorg, Kappatatap, Lynyrd,
  Mote, Nervewrack, Ornamental, Pap, Quinsy, Ringworm, Salman, Tharbin, Ultravox,
  Vincenzo, Windigo, Xerxes, Yolanda and Zap. Approach them, if you must, with caution,
  for they are skilful catapultists and have a stockpile of pebbles to ward off strangers.


  A HISTORY OF STARLINGS

  A third of the world''s starling population lives in North America. The fact that
  possibly over a billion starlings roam the skies is due to one man, a rich New York
  drug manufacturer named Eugene Schieffelin, who in 1890 released eighty imported
  starlings in Central Park as part of his thoroughly sensible plan to introduce to
  the United States all the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare. Those who
  do not love starlings see them as pests, and indeed it is not unknown for a hungry
  flock to devour twenty tons of potatoes, spread histoplasmosis, and make life difficult
  for bluebirds and woodpeckers. Attempts to reduce or scare off pesky starlings have
  included the use of artificial owls, radio broadcasts of the starlings'' alarm call,
  Roman candles, and a mass publicity drive to encourage people to eat starling pie
  (with recipes).


  This is what a starling looks like (side view). Best when not cooked in a pie.


  DOBSON IN RESIDENCE

  One of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five-year period
  living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. Such was the hold on him of this
  location that he devoted no less than sixteen pamphlets to it. According to the
  statistician Aloysius Nestingbird, Dobson wrote more words about this factory than
  on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such a fascination
  upon Dobson? How significant is it that, during his stay there, the factory was
  still functioning, producing thousands of tins of evaporated milk every week, and
  not, as it is today, an abandoned ruin populated only by screeching birds? Was the
  workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up residence in an unused room on
  the mezzanine floor, and that he had attached his own design of bolts and latches
  to the door to prevent his being disturbed? Or that the carefully-lettered sign
  on the door, reading "S Q Perkins, Janitorial Padre", was a fake of Dobson''s devising?
  Was Dobson responsible for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated
  milk noted in a big ledger by the management''s security team? Was it really necessary
  for the security team to march about the premises in gangs of four, dressed in uniforms
  not unlike those of a fascist junta, accompanied by howling, slavering dogs, each
  as tall as a ten-year-old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at
  the end of a security tour? Did a wet-behind-the-ears junior evaporated milk technical
  consultant take the rap for the missing tins? Was he dismissed and did he have his
  epaulettes thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson doing
  in that room for five years? Why are the answers to these cogent questions entirely
  absent from Dobson''s pamphlets? And, most importantly, what birds screech there
  now?


  THE TALE OF GASPARD

  Gaspard worked for the Gas Board. In appearance, he resembled the man dressed in
  red raising his left arm in Hieronymus Bosch''s painting The Ship of Fools. (Incidentally,
  while we are--briefly--on the subject of art, you may or may not know that the famous
  foot from the credit sequence of Monty Python''s Flying Circus was taken from Angelo
  Bronzino''s Allegory : Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time.) Gaspard was both dutiful and
  dismaying. An air of glumness hovered o''er him; to some, it was a visible aura.
  Flies and other tiny annoying things with wings seemed to follow him around. Had
  he the wit, Gaspard could have made himself useful to the world''s entomologists,
  but he was diffident as well as being dutiful and dismaying. His Gas Board desk
  was a sorry piece of office furniture, rickety and fragile. Gaspard sat at it for
  many, many hours each day, to no apparent purpose. There is a story by John Cheever
  which ends with the question: "Oh, what can you do with a man like that?" The same
  can be asked of Gaspard, for there is something almost inhuman in his dullness.
  Let us whisk him away, then, and place him in the icy wastes of Northern Canada,
  sitting on a felled log, surrounded by frisky reindeer, sipping from his flask of
  piping hot broth, as stars sparkle in the clear night sky. A voice booms from the
  heavens: "Gaspard! Gaspard!" He is stricken with terror, yet he knows this is the
  most important thing that has ever happened to him, so he reaches into the pocket
  of his anorak and takes out a little notepad and a biro. Irritatingly, just as he
  is about to jot down whatever supernatural commands he is to be given, the voice
  falls silent, and the only sound is that of a pitiless Arctic gale roaring in his
  ears. We shall leave him there, as he drinks the last of his broth, and though he
  remains ignorant of his destiny, we can rest assured that Gaspard is soon to become
  the Stipendiary Vizier of Cack and know aught but wassail and glee for all eternity,
  for he is immortal, and he is magnificent.


  EXCESSIVE REVOLVER SHOOTING & RELATED MATTERS

  My old mucker Max Decharne has sent an amusing list gleaned from his current reading
  matter, What The Censor Saw by John Trevelyan. The British Board of Film Classification
  has always been keen to protect the public from depictions of moral turpitude, and
  Max has helpfully noted the following examples of forbidden topics:

  1913 -- Indecorous dancing. Native customs in foreign lands abhorrent to British
  ideas.

  1914 -- Incidents injurious to the reputation of Govermental Departments. Unnecessary
  exhibitions of feminine underclothing. The effects of vitriol throwing. Stories
  tinctured with salacious wit. Sensual exposition of Eugenic Doctrines.

  1919 -- Criminal poisoning by dissemination of germs. Excessive revolver shooting.
  Animals gnawing men and children*. Clutching hands.

  1925 -- Libels on the British nursing profession. Bolshevik propaganda. Abdominal
  contortions in dancing.

  1926 -- Employee selling his wife to employer to cover defalcations. Severed human
  heads. Degrading exhibitions of animal passion. Indecent wall decorations. Dangerous
  mischief, easily imitated by children. Lecherous old men. Themes which are likely
  to wound the just susceptibilities of our Allies. Comic hanging. Breaking bottles
  on men''s heads.

  1931 -- Marriages within the prohibitive degree. Girls'' clothes pulled off. The
  Salvation Army shown in an unfavourable light.

  * NOTE : Presumably scenes showing animals gnawing women were allowed, then.'
