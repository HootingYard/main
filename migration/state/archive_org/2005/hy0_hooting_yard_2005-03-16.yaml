full_text: 'FORGIVE AND FORGET

  By Edwin F. Roberts

  What you tell me is certainly very extraordinary, set a grave looking gentlemanly
  man, to a pale agitated youth of about two and 20. But I have ceased to wonder at
  many things that have appeared to me still more strange. Ah, you speak with such
  unconcerned because you have not had your feelings insulted your affections trifled
  with as I have, I will never forgive her father for it, and he clenched his hand
  in a rage. You will regret your words, Philip, was the reply, forgive and forget.
  Never, even if I did the one I could not do the other, and with the gesture of a
  man who had already made up his mind, in addition to having convinced himself that
  he has good reason to speak and feel in such why''s, he added, if I can, I may forgive
  but I can never forget. Possibly not retorted to the other with a smile, for it
  is not in our power to forget as we please. But there is a latitude of meaning to
  the latter portion of your sentence which you will remark at a future time. The
  young man stared at him in surprise for a moment, his features were convulsed, his
  face flushed. Do you think, said he, I can alter my sentiments towards a man who
  has heaped every indignity upon me in the presence of the woman I loved, who has
  humiliated me till I feel as if my brow were branded with the remembrance of some
  disgraceful act. But it is well, he added abruptly he''s unprovoked aggression upon
  me will retaliate upon himself, he too will feel for Elon cannot so soon forget.
  Here he broke off while a tear trembled upon his eyelids. The speaker was a young
  man who stationed and occupation could not, at the first glance be distinctly told,
  he was well made, with a good looking oval face, hazel eyes, brown hair, good strong
  teeth, limbs firmly set, and if there was anything to find fault with him personally,
  it was an expression of firmness that amounted to obstinacy in the strong clasp
  of the jaw, and in the quickly kindling, I. his coat was a town cut, but his breeches
  top boots and the riding whip spoke of the country. In fact, he was of that class
  known as a gentleman farmer. His parents having been dead for some years, had left
  him to manage a compact, well stocked establishment, situated in the heart of one
  of the most beautiful rural districts of sorry, not far from where he dwelt was
  a neighbor''s house, a handsome Villa residents, in which Mr. Gilmore, a retired
  trader, his wife and daughter, now about 18 years of age resided locally location
  of several years have caused a reciprocal kindly feeling to grow up into a warm
  friendship. And an almost constant intercourse between the young people have produced
  that very natural consequence. They had fallen in love. They had planted their truth.
  Their parents had sanctioned their engagement and the young man yet now a bachelor,
  was looking anxiously forward to the day that should make him a Benedict. In order
  to explain to the reader how the conversation arose with which the story opens,
  we will in a few words explain the causes that led to such a result. It was on a
  beautiful evening in the autumn when a night begin to grow long, and the Twilight
  suddenly deepens into purple and then into darkness. When the winds begin to moan
  and the stars grow, they''re more muffled when you hear extraordinary sound in the
  chimneys, and the vein creaking upon the gables when the fire sparkles up Gailey
  when the lamp is on the table and the table is before the fire. When people grow
  cozy and snug, and as merry as crickets while they draw their chairs closer, we
  say on such an evening there was a happy group assembled in Mr. Gilmore''s back
  parlor. Ellen Gilmore was seated on the sofa after having played and sang one or
  two of Philips favorite ballads knitting a purse and Philip his arm and circled
  her in circling her waist was mischievously, capturing the threads and receiving
  an occasional scolding. But his joyous face his radiant eyes showed that the more
  he was scolded, the happier he grew. While Ella now and then cast a sidelong look
  of love upon him that was as expressive as anything could be of joy creating power
  of love. The old lady with spectacles on those were superintending, the servant
  who was engaged with the toast. As for Mr. Gilmore himself, he was unusually agitated,
  with his hands under his coat. He now strode across the room, then stood in the
  space formed by the bow window, cast a glance towards the two young lovers, which
  was more charged with electricity than ordinarily, if there was a storm brewing
  on Philip Harwood, lovely and rosy horizon. It was evident that it would not be
  long in breaking. The old man grew more fidgety, and as he heard them both laugh
  and Ellen scold. He turned around at last, and then a somewhat sharp stern tone,
  said Philip, sir, was the startled reply. As Philip turned towards him, his eyes
  dilating to their widest I saw your friend Mr squander today, there was an unmistakable
  emphasis on the word. Philip instantly started and color deeply then bit his lip
  and said, Oh, indeed, yes. And I was very much surprised at what he told me, continued
  Mr. Gilmore getting excited. Is it anything that interests me, sir? demanded Philip
  in a cold and collected voice which appeared to be hardly assumed. It concerns you
  very much indeed, sir. And the tones of the old man grew more distant and threatening.
  Well, my dear sir, answer the other in a tone half of insolence, half of irritability.
  If it concerns me, only let it remain as it is, I will look into those matters myself.
  Ellen herself all this time was in a most distressing position. She felt there was
  something unpleasant about to happen. She was half frightened at her father''s tone,
  and she felt not a little astonished at the offhand manner in which the young man
  behaved. The good old lady Mrs. Gilmore was also evidently surprised at this sudden
  change in the aspect of things. I have to tell you, sir, said Mr. Gilmore, standing
  before Philip and speaking with some asperity that I have seen this man who calls
  himself your friend and whom I do not respect and he has told me Ah, interrupted
  Philip, you do not respect him and yet you listen to him when he speaks of me. But
  still, it strikes me that this is my affair alone. Young man, retorted Mr. Gilmore.
  If I or any other member of my family were not also interested in it, you would
  not have found me either anxious or willing to listen to anything that this man
  in particular has to say. But as it does concern my child''s welfare, I judged it
  rights to hear that which was voluntarily delivered. Proceeds, sir, said Philip
  coldly, but his lips trembled. It seems to me the time to be catechized Philip,
  exclaimed Ellen in a reproachful tone, accompanying it with an appealing gesture.
  I was told that you were in London last week when we understood that you''d gone
  to buy horses. Exactly, said Philip that you also lost at the gaming table 300 pounds
  or some I know you had laid aside for making further improvements on your farm and
  increasing your stock. For money was my own sir, said Philip, and he was cold and
  his cheeks bloodless as marble.

  But not a week ago, you put up for sale three small houses left you by your father,
  which brought you in at least 250 pounds a year and that you also paid the greater
  part of the purchase money away for some betting losses you sustained that the last
  new market races. But sir, retorted the other in a tone of the coldest irony mingled
  with schagrin and bitterness. This does not justify any man''s prying into my affairs.
  My money was my own I repeat. unquestionably, sir. It was a scented Mr. Gilmore
  with distant dignity. Philip again, said Ellen timidly touching his arm as if to
  restrain his violent temper. Do not answer my father. Thus, he means well, if hearing
  all the idle tales that are circulated regarding a man be proof of it, but added
  Philip suddenly breaking off, supposing all this to be true, what is to be inferred
  from it? simply this, replied Mr. Gilmore. That I shall decline to trust my daughter''s
  welfare and happiness in the hands of one whose new career of dissipation threatens
  to beggar him who spends 300 pounds in one night at a gaming table, and who disposes
  of his property like a wasteful prodigal in paying losses upon horse racing, and
  then other informations that are unknown. paellas death, with eyes flashing and
  with a furious gesture, Philip almost leaped towards him, and in a hoarse voice
  said, Do you dare speak to me in this manner, sir? Sir, replied the old man trembling
  with passion, your insolence only confirms the opinion I''ve been forced to hold
  of your worthlessness. There is the door, sir. Ellen, exclaimed Philip, casting
  an appealing look towards her. I repeat my father''s word, sir, you have insulted
  his gray hairs. You have insulted me. Go, let us meet no more, and she pointed to
  the door. But hear me he cried, as if he would have explained that which had now
  become too late. The hasty word had been spoken, the ill blood moved. Ellen leave
  the room set her father, then addressing Philip, if you declined to go so we shall
  be compelled to leave you alone in it. And with a dignified air Mr. Gilmore took
  Ellen''s hand and was leading her away. There passed over Ellen''s charming face
  such an expression of dismay, despair and terror that the impetuosity of Philip
  was stayed at once. He would have given all that he had the whole world his life
  to have recalled back his words, but they had gone forth, there was no turning back
  for him. Therefore, how often have liked vain, angry or hasty expressions? The severed
  friends broken the most binding ties sown dissension between lovers destroyed human
  happiness, and being as productive of evil as if the plague itself had stricken
  the circle where such unforeseen circumstances arise. Ellen, for the love of God,
  cried Philip, making one more attempt. Go, sir, I have nothing more to say. And
  with a haughty wave of the hand, she drew from him. Ah, he explained, exclaimed,
  is it indeed So, while you will live to repent of this both of you, you will regret
  this because it is a paltry means of exchanging the old lover for the new because
  your good father''s worldly prudence sees in my present embarrassments of failure
  as regards the establishment he had concluded you should keep. It was at these black
  and noble, ignoble words of this accusation which brought improbability upon its
  very face that Ellen with a shriek fainted in her father''s arms, while Philip hastily
  rushed forth from the house. It was this unhappy difference, therefore, that threatened
  to wreck forever the happiness of two who in every other respect seemed formed for
  each other. Mr. Gilmore might have been to precipitate but have chosen his time
  better. But when a father has his child''s happiness at stake, it must be forgiven
  him in his anxiety, he does not precisely study etiquette. And on the other hand,
  what was it that had come over Philip Harwood, once so ingenuous and candid once
  so in genuis, and so tractable, it had for some time passed been remarked that his
  visits were irregular, that he made apologies phase absence in a tone that began
  to grow sharp, Coriolis and abrupt.

  That last he was not questioned. And as he was the accepted lover, as his marriage
  with Elon was a settled thing. his absence or his presence was not to be wondered
  at But he was moody falling at times into reveries out of which he would start like
  a man upon whom some unwelcome train of awakening thought forces itself. Rumors
  to have his wild flight of dissipation of disreputable companionship of strange
  visitors at his smug little farm of horse racing, and many other things that may
  induce a man whose mind vaccinates from any cause to enter into with avidity were
  amplified with 100 tongues. his temper after this grew still worse, when he returned
  at any time is comfortable, but solitary home where an old housekeeper and one or
  two female domestics, together with a few farm servants, made up a tolerable household,
  but with whom he of course could have no communion, when with his brain on fire,
  anger, conscious ruin, each by turns goading him on when he reflected upon the great
  treasure he lost in Ellen, upon the widened, wordless desolation that began to fill
  his own heart at the prospect of losing her, besides, the bitter reflection that
  he had, by such a show of temper, totally alienated her father, and an almost natural
  consequence of his violent his insolent rudeness herself from him. When he thought
  upon all this, he was ready to go mad. Be it so he would matter recklessly, then
  she is lost through him through her father''s purse proud insolence, who thinks
  more of his paltry 100 that he does have his child happiness. She loves me, it shall
  be the stepping stone to revenge, I will neither forget nor forgive. It was with
  a mingled sentiment of disgust, horror and hate that he looked upon the letters
  which were daily lying on his table. He knew who they were from, but who was involved
  so frightfully so mashed as it were, that to draw back appear to be ruin, to go
  forward would be to trust to the luck ever so fluctuating of a gambler. He cursed
  the hour that the first placed him in that perilous condition, because the one that
  had blinded him, the friends, apparently so Frank candid, but convivial, that was
  the word who attempted him and the cards that began the horse racing and the betting
  that had finally plunged him into this horrible state. Yet, even with all leads,
  had it not been for Mr. Gilmore severity, for the sudden change in Ellen''s nature,
  that of all unexpected things of most unexpected had it not been for all this, things
  were not so bad, but they might have desperate sacrifices have been remedied, and
  was not altogether his fault. His nature had been imposed upon, and he had been
  robbed or so he thought, I will be revenged he mattered. It matters not at whose
  cost at whose sacrifice most likely my own. She is so bound and mingled up in my
  nature that I cannot forget her, and I can never speak or see her more. That has
  caused enough for ruin on one hand, can she so lightly cast away from her remembrance
  of me? Can she forget me? Can she he would cry in agony? Can she tear the cherished
  image from her heart? But why do I question myself bus? What a man sews that also
  shall he reap? Within a week to Mr. Gilmore''s dismay, for though he fully intended
  to act up to his word. Still, he felt a deep interest in Philips fate and have the
  young man expressed proper contrition his act of folly might have been canceled
  and his headlong progress stayed to the terror of Elon and the surprise of everyone.
  Philip Harwood had sold off all that he had the farm, the furniture, the stock,
  everything was broken up, and the servants dismissed. That place was shut up, no
  one knew who had bought it. And in the front of the pleasant house, which at one
  time used to be the pride of the country for tulips, June flowers dalias and 1000
  others for In fact, the floor of Philip harwoods garden was very choice and very
  beautiful. Now, grass began to grow and the gravel paths were on swept, weed choked
  up the flowers. All things grew rank.

  The windows were closed and an air of desolation reigned over all Philip himself
  had disappeared, and nothing was seen of him. It was conjectured that here that
  once and unhesitatingly plunged into vices from whence it was now hopeless to reclaim
  him, or that he had emigrated in a sudden of disgust. The effect of always upon
  Ellen was frightful enough, roused by every sentiment that could suggest to her
  a sense of duty. indignant at the outrage which had been made upon her parent, feeling
  keenly the insults which had been offered to herself, the loving girl with a sad
  brow, a pale cheek, an apathetic ear, and an altogether language and relaxed movement
  bore up while she could against her misery, she had returned to fillable his presence
  and had no memento of him left, save that of association, habit and feeling, if
  indeed these be not the all in all. At home by tacit consent, the name of Philip
  was banished, no lips spoke it, and though Ellen thought that this was carrying
  harshness to an extreme, still, she would resolve not to be the first to break the
  implied vow. The consequence of all this was a severe prostrating illness that laid
  her upon a sick bed, from which it was a great chance if she should ever rise up
  again. If to inflict a deadly wound in the parents bosom was Philips mode of vengeance,
  he was likely to do it. The conclusions Mr. Gilmore came to with regard to Philip
  will not however strictly just, he was culpable but not criminal act, a company
  acting upon impulse smarting under a sentiment of false shame, the young man thought
  to repair his losses by the same means which should be used to entrap him. He was
  as a natural consequence, the victim to a still more serious extent. The evil had
  been precipitated to by the rupture which occasioned his parting from Ellen and
  the wanderer, husbanding the little money left him, having paid all and shoveling
  all with gloomily traversing the land, having with a morbid self satisfaction, determined
  to wait till Elon died and then go and kill himself upon her grave. And indeed,
  it seemed as if he should not have to wait very long for such a confirmation. In
  the meantime, for some reason or other Mr. Gilmore after six months have elapsed,
  repurchased Philip harwoods, farm furniture and stock and reinstated the housekeeper
  and the servants, so that the establishment soon began to wear its old orderly and
  quiet air. The cattle browsed in the meadows, the teams were afield, the dairy sent
  its produce to the market, and the garden looked as beautiful as ever. But in the
  old man''s house, one flower was evidently drooping to death. Ellen was dreadfully
  altered. She was thin and pale as a statue of marble, and her own glossy hair hung
  danken matted on her neck. She was a weakened, she was weakened with grief. Sorry,
  she was so weakened with grief that she appeared to crawl listlessly, about by mere
  muscular volition, than by effort of will. And it was evident that the heartbroken
  girl was rapidly descending into the tomb, that she was soon to be snatched away
  from her parents, unless, indeed Providence could interposing her behalf in some
  unexpected way. By the physician''s advice, she was removed to the seacoast, more
  in the hope of distracting her thoughts from to greater contemplation of that grief,
  which, like a worm of a bad fed on her damask shriek than from any hope they had
  in her restoration to help her mother, untiring and our murmuring with the most
  patient resignation, the most assiduous fondness attended her night and day, she
  endeavored to stifle her own bitterness, in order not to give poor Ellen more calls
  for grief if possible. While silent and warm. Her father, though, almost plunged
  into despair, kept his sorrows himself. On one fine day when the sky was blue and
  the breeze bland and calm. Ellen, tottering more than walking was led along by her
  parents to the noble Esplanade formed by the hand of nature, under the sward downs
  of blank. Their walk was solitary, as the place was deserted by all the visitors.
  In fact, as it extended for the best part of a mile, it might be considered a sufficiently
  long walk to

  a pull any but those healthy pedestrians who laugh at a dozen miles. The words not
  printed was bright and undulating like the waves in those word, not printed mornings
  by Claude or Turner, and there was a kin of subdued mode. which arose from its mighty
  breast, as if it had been falling into slumber. And the whole aspect of nature grand
  expansive and vast as it was, had a beauty that is indescribable, but always imbued
  with the sentiment of vitality with life. Ellen only ghostly and almost ghastly,
  moving about like one risen from the dead. They sat down as she felt wearied upon
  a seat placed there for the accommodation of passers by. With a question in glance,
  her parents looked in her face, and her reply was a sad, sickly smile, and a slight
  pressure of the hand. Do you feel better my child asked her mother. Know Not much,
  dear mother, but I shall be soon was the reply. Her voice had the resignation of
  despair in it. The lips of the poor mother began to tremble, while looking into
  the thin white face of her child, and the hands of the Father shook as he dashed
  them across his own demise. There was such voiceless, heartbreaking anguish in that
  momentary silence, and the three drew closer together upon the bench, where were
  on they sat, as if to take one last fond embrace before parting forever in this
  world. Mother, father, she said at last in a faint tone, it may be wicked in me
  It may be disobedient, but but I cannot help thinking of poor Philip who knows where
  he is now. I do not know was her father apply? It was without harshness. He did
  not reproach her with speaking of the last man, he would have given much to behold
  him even at that moment. I should die happy if I could see him if I could touch
  him and bless him. I feel by my own heart that he loved me that in spite of his
  cruel words he has ever loved me. That feeling may have saved him, but heavens will
  be done. And she cast her meek eyes towards that heaven whose flat she bowed to.
  While that''s engaged, they were not aware of the presence of a road beaten dust
  covered a man who approached them with a slow and measured step. His cheeks were
  haggard and sunken, and his hair hung and wild elf lock around his brows. His bizarre
  all together have that woebegone, desolate and miserable expression that belongs
  to men who have sustained a calamity which has swept everything from them, that
  has decimated and destroyed literally everything in life, fruit blossom and plant.
  When he came up to the group, he started and stopped, and then as if he had suddenly
  become conscious of the presence of others, he said fixedly, first at one then at
  the other, he recognized Ellen, it was a shocking sight to behold these two miserable
  wrecks of life and happiness gaze one upon the other, what a tide of feelings and
  regulation swept over their souls. In that short period of time. It was broken by
  the voice of Philip Harwood. For it was he himself aftering a cry that rang with
  a cadence almost supernatural. Elon, he exclaimed and fell upon his knees. Philip,
  bless you. She fell forward. Philip received her in his arms, she was dead.'
