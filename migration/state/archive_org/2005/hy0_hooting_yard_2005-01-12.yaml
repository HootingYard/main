full_text: 'ON CURLEWS

  There I was, crumpled and decisive, standing between two trees on the edge of the
  Blister Lane Bypass. The trees were both yews, I think. I was looking for curlews.
  The first one I saw was made of plastic, it was a toy or perhaps a decorative figurine.
  It had been abandoned in the gutter. Then I saw a second curlew, swooping across
  the blue, blue sky. I did not know it then, but within hours there would be no blue
  to be seen, for dark and brooding thunderclouds would waft in from the east. A third
  curlew appeared in my mind''s eye. It was gigantic and ferocious and terrifying.
  I shuddered. I walked away from the yews, in the direction of Bodger''s Spinney,
  pulling my resplendent teal cardigan tight about my torso. There was a fourth curlew,
  an embroidered one, on my necktie. Why in the name of heaven was I wearing a necktie?
  All of a sudden this length of fabric wrapped around my neck felt like a hangman''s
  noose. I took it off, with violent jerks, and discarded it in a puddle, where it
  would remain until discovered later that day by a scavenging hobbledehoy from The
  Bashings, that gloomy cluster of huts which sane people shirk. Oh, as the tie dropped
  into the puddle I saw a fugitive reflection in the water of the embroidered curlew,
  so that made five. It was still only ten in the morning.

  By five past ten I had seen another dozen curlews, or it may have been a single
  curlew seen twelve times, I cannot be altogether certain. I was standing on Sawdust
  Bridge at the time, feeling hopeless and disgruntled and cantankerous. The tunic
  I was wearing beneath my cardigan, which I had stolen from an ingrate, was playing
  havoc with my [invented skin disease], and rashes were appearing. My doctor had
  prescribed a daily dose of some sort of bean mashed up into a bowl of milk of magnesia,
  and I had forgotten to take my dose that morning, so keen was I to see curlews.

  Later I took a mop and began to clean the floor of one of the corridors in an ugly
  building which shall remain nameless. I was indoors now, so unlikely to see any
  curlews. But lo!, little Maisie--a polka-dot-dressed orphan whose parents perished
  in the Tet Offensive--came rushing up to me clutching her stamp album and showed
  me her latest acquisitions, a set of twenty bird-related thematics issued by the
  Tantarabim Interim Authority. I could not help but note, as I shared my Brazil nuts
  with starving Maisie, that eight of the stamps depicted curlews.

  On my way home, as the evening closed in and dark thoughts of skulduggery frolicked
  in my throbbing skull, I saw a dead curlew on the canal towpath. Bird detectives
  had already thrown a cordon around it, so I was unable to take a closer look.

  That night, by candlelight, I took out my ledger and gave names to each of the twenty-six
  curlews I had seen. Alcibiades, Bim, Chumpot, Dromedary, Eidolon, Flaps, Gash, Heliogabalus,
  Inthod... That is how I started my list. Then I recalled that I had set out to see
  forty-four curlews. I gnashed my teeth in misery and dejection. And I recalled that
  I had forgotten to wring out the mop.

  You will recognise the above as an extract from Dobson''s pamphletto A Description
  Of And Reverie Upon Forty-Four Curlews (out of print). Note that I use the word
  "pamphletto" to distinguish this work from the general run of pamphlets spewed out
  by Dobson. Note, too, that at this time, and in this place, I am not going to explain
  the difference between the pamphlets and the pamphlettos. Let it gnaw away at your
  mental innards, if you will.

  Our purpose today is to subject the text to analysis. I have been asked innumerable
  times--well, numerable, in that I can count the times I have been asked, on the
  fingers of one maimed hand--whether Dobson is telling the truth, or making the whole
  thing up. No matter how rigorous our analysis, irrespective of the analytical techniques
  employed, I am afraid to say this is an unanswerable question. One would need to
  delve deep into the biography of the pamphleteer, deeper than anyone with working
  wits in their head has ever seen fit to delve, to pronounce the passage true or
  false. It may even be a combination of the two, partly fact and partly fiction.
  Or Dobson may have sincerely believed it to be true, when it was actually an hallucination,
  or a series of hallucinations, brought on by exhaustion or the jangles or entrancement
  by a tiny sinister gnome-like fellow dressed all in green. It is unlikely we will
  ever know.

  This is not to say that we cannot analyse the passage, using certain techniques
  developed by Blotzmann, to ascertain the more important question of whether Dobson
  would have known a curlew when he saw one. After all, he was a man of boundless
  ornithological ignorance, as is attested not only by his inamorata Marigold Chew
  and by several of his acquaintances, not all of them shady characters, but by the
  pamphleteer himself, in his own words, notably in the pamphlet My Boundless Ornithological
  Ignorance, Together With A Paean Of Praise To Googie Withers (out of print). And
  careful study of the present text reveals that, in spite of the promise in the title
  to describe forty-four curlews, Dobson barely has a word to say about their appearance.
  Let us tabulate, in an objective tabulating manner, what he does say.

  Curlew Number One : plastic

  Curlew Number Two : swooping

  Curlew Number Three : gigantic, ferocious and terrifying, but also imaginary

  Curlew Number Four : embroidered

  Curlew Number Five : Curlew Number Four reflected in a puddle

  It is with reluctance that I am going to abandon my exciting tabulation, or tabulature,
  so soon, but quite frankly Dobson has nothing whatsoever to say about the other
  twenty-one curlews he claims to have seen that day, at least nothing that persuades
  us they were actually curlews as opposed to, say, godwits or pratincoles or starlings.
  At no point does he describe what he is looking at in the kind of detail we would
  like if we were to be convinced that he knew what he was talking about.

  This is the level of piercing insight one is able to gain by applying Blotzmannist
  analysis techniques to a piece of text, although of course it is only piercing when
  the text under scrutiny mentions birds. Absent birds, and you are left rudderless,
  disorientated and whirling ever more rapidly into a maelstrom of mental chaos. Or
  so I am told. By Blotzmann himself. Shouting his head off. On the blower.

  NOTE : Many thanks to Vincent Byrne for "pamphletto". (And "booklettes", not yet
  deployed.)


  INCONSEQUENTIAL TRIVIA

  There are those who make fun of my continuing fascination with the Kennedy assassination--good
  afternoon, Pansy Cradledew--as if that little pang of excitement I get when I read
  the words grassy knoll or Umbrella Man or Agent Hosty means I am some kind of bug-eyed
  conspiracy theorist of questionable personal habits.

  Actually I think it is the mountain of theories and documentation and obsessive
  poring over minutiae that interests me, much as the similar activities of, say,
  Loch Ness Monster hunters have an inherently attractive monomania. Anyway, for those
  (and they are legion) who like this sort of thing, here is a Kennedy Assassination
  Fact.

  In November 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald''s wife Marina, and the two children, were staying
  in the house of Ruth Paine, a Quaker, in the suburb of Irving. Oswald stayed in
  a Dallas rooming-house during the week and joined them at weekends. He kept his
  Mannlicher Carcano rifle in Ruth Paine''s garage. Blah blah blah. The interesting
  fact is as follows. Ruth''s husband Michael Paine (who had moved out of the house
  for reasons unrelated to the Oswalds) was the great-great-grandson of Ralph Waldo
  Emerson and also a direct descendant of one of the signatories of the Declaration
  of Independence, Robert Treat Paine.

  I am really glad to know that smidgeon of information, useless as it is. Now you
  know it too.


  Spookily linked by fate : Ralph Waldo Emerson, Marina Oswald, FBI Agent James Hosty,
  Robert Treat Paine and Umbrella Man.


  WHEN I WAS INTERROGATED

  I don''t remember much about my interrogation, but under the new Freedom of Information
  Act I managed to get hold of a cassette tape. For the best part of half an hour
  it''s a mishmash of hisses, squeaks, mufflement and what sounds like a water vole
  gnawing on a wet twig. One part of my interrogation has survived, however, and I
  have taken the trouble to transcribe it for you, so you may study it with care.

  Q--When was the last time you stood in the middle of a suspension bridge in a high
  wind, emptying your lungs and belting out the Uruguayan national anthem at the top
  of your voice?

  A--Last Thursday.

  Q--Were you accompanied on piccolo by Von Straubenzee and on cor anglais by Tack?

  A--I was.

  Q--Are you aware that Tack is wanted by the police of four continents for doing
  weird things with the pips of citrus fruits?

  A--I am not.

  Q--Or that Von Straubenzee is not Von Straubenzee''s real name?

  A--I was not aware of that.

  Q--Do not be curt.

  A--I am not being curt.

  Q--We shall be the judges of your curtness. What is that noise in your pocket?

  A--That is my water vole gnawing a wet twig it eked from the riverbank just before
  I was placed under arrest.

  Q--Did Constable Fang tell you you could bring a water vole to the top secret interrogation
  centre?

  A--He didn''t say one way or the other.

  Q--That will be all. We will call you back after several ukases have been issued.

  I kept a close eye on the papers for the next few days, waiting for the ukases to
  be issued, but they never were, nor was I ever dragged back to the top secret interrogation
  centre. Tack vanished without trace, but a month or so later I ran into Von Straubenzee
  outside the Palace of Churns. I asked him if it was true that his real name was
  not Von Straubenzee.

  "Van," he said, "Van".

  He was of a delicate constitution, so I didn''t press him further. Many years later,
  his sister told me that it was very important to him that his surname and his blood
  group were "in alignment", as she put it. He was a great piccolo player, and so
  was his sister. But my singing voice is not what it was, and I no longer sing. I
  just stand on the windswept suspension bridge and remember, with a lump in my throat,
  and another water vole in my pocket, gnawing on another wet twig.


  STRESS, DISTRESS, TRISTESSE

  Most readers will have seen one of those lists of life-events ranked in order of
  the stress they cause. (If you haven''t, go here, but come straight back.) Now,
  our in-house team of psychologists, brain experts, phrenologists, mesmerists and
  cranial integument analysts have devised a definitive list based on a study of everyone
  on earth, alive and dead. Here are the top ten stress-inducing events.

  1. Staring at a bee.

  2. Inky fingers.

  3. Eating fruit in a concrete paddling pool.

  4. Dreaming of natterjack toads.

  5. Broken Godspell soundtrack LP.

  6. Impenetrable flimflam.

  7. Klaxon next to ear.

  8. Being trapped in a birdcage with a starving chough.

  9. Library ticket panic.

  10. Unravelling Fairisle sweater.


  THE PRIVATE MEMOIRS & CONFESSIONS OF AN IGNORANT ORNITHOLOGIST

  Hooting Yard Blog, day one, and one''s thoughts turn, of course, to ornithology.
  How better to spend one''s time than to read an extract from The Private Memoirs
  & Confessions of an Ignorant Ornithologist?

  Tuesday. Saw something sitting in a tree. It had a head, two legs, and seemed to
  be covered in feathers. I only saw the back of the head, so could not tell if it
  had a beak. I suspect it may have been a linnet.

  Wednesday. Trained my powerful binoculars on a speck up in the sky in the far distance.
  It was moving quite fast. Perhaps a wren?

  Thursday. Saw a worm being dragged from the soil by something much bigger than it,
  possibly with wings. Rang Dennis to tell him about it. He said he''d come and check,
  but by the time he arrived, puffed out, ten minutes later, the thing was gone, and
  there was no sign of the worm. Dennis said it was probably a cassowary.

  Friday. Overheard a couple of people in the park talking about sedge warblers. Later,
  I discovered these are a life-form which all authorities agree is a type of bird.
  Ticked off a box in my notepad.

  Saturday. Went to the church fair. When I said how nice all the flags and bunting
  looked, Dennis said, "That''s also the name of a bird!" "Flags and bunting?" I asked.
  "No, you nitwit," he said, "Just bunting. Also known as the ortolan." I was very,
  very impressed with the breadth of his knowledge.

  Sunday. Woke to find an owl sitting on my head.

  Marvellous stuff. And here''s a crumpled map, followed by a resurrectionist plea.



  TEN YEARS AGO

  Hooting Yard has now been a presence on what Tony Blair and I like to call the Information
  Superhighway for more than a decade. It is an arresting thought that the site has
  existed for a longer period of time than that required by a Jesuit to completely
  brainwash a child. This startling fact prompts two further thoughts, today. First,
  I am minded to add a slogan to that red rectangle at the top, saying "Dispensing
  prose to hoi polloi since 2003". Second, that on a day such as this, when my brain
  is empty, I can hark back ten years and repost something from so long ago that it
  is unlikely any of you lot will remember it. I certainly don''t. Exactly ten years
  ago, on 11 January 2005, this piece appeared under the unwieldy title First Spruce,
  Now Rusty And Squalid. For this reappearance I have taken the opportunity to insert
  a few paragraph breaks to make for easier reading. I am sure you can think of a
  way to show your gratitude for such thoughtfulness.

  Consider that fall. One day, you are spry, preening and spruce. Then, knocked sideways,
  cast down, become rusty and squalid. How does it happen? Is there a moment, a split
  second, when jauntiness turns to sackcloth and ashes? What would your journal read?

  Eleven a.m. : o! such bliss and splendour! How blessed am I to be among the animate
  and quick.

  Eleven o one a.m.: Ach! Does earth harbour a wretch as miserable as I, one who crumbles
  in despair and is fit only to slither in the muck with the worms?

  How are we to make sense of such a catastrophic change? Crystal balls may help seers
  and soothsayers see into the future, but is it true, as some say, that we can make
  sense of the present by staring long and intently with our eyes wide open at the
  surface of a muddy pond over by Bodger''s Spinney? And not any of the ponds there,
  just one, the most brackish of the ponds, the one which is inky black and fathomless.
  What will we see on the surface of that pond if we stare at it long enough?

  I will tell you. Ignore the flies and mosquitoes and the mutant tadpoles that occasionally
  disturb the water, and sooner or later, you will be able to discern, dimly at first,
  but with increasing clarity, the incredible face of the Psychopond Dweller, shimmering,
  gaunt, bewitched and bewitching, and its expression will reveal to you the meaning
  of neither past nor future but of the present moment, radical, decisive and, like
  the cockles and mussels in the old song, alive, alive-oh.


  THE MINCING CORSAIR

  Many moons have passed since we last received a letter of complaint from Dr Ruth
  Pastry, but she has at last been stirred into action. The following email arrived
  the other day:

  Dear Mr Key : I was disturbed to note, in your item headed Petrochemical Shiver-Me-Timbers
  Conclave (20th December 2004), that you unthinkingly preceded the word corsair with
  bloodthirsty. This is not only a cliche, but also panders to the stereotype of corsairs
  as violent maniacs who careen around the decks of sailing ships off the Barbary
  Coast with gleaming cutlasses clenched between their equally gleaming teeth. I have
  met many corsairs in my time, and not one of them bears any resemblance to this
  nonsensical image. Indeed, the corsair with whom I was best acquainted, in that
  he was my fiance for a few months in the early 1970s, was a gentle soul named Federico
  Dellapiccola de Grunwald, who spoke with a pronounced lisp and whose usual form
  of locomotion, when he wasn''t prancing, was to mince. I do not think he had ever
  been near a cutlass in his life. Much of his time, whenever he was absent from his
  buccaneering privateer ship, was spent raising rhododendrons and dahlias, holding
  raffles in aid of the local orphanage, and gambolling o''er green fields with puppies
  and flopsy-tailed bunny rabbits. Next time you write about corsairs, please be more
  accurate. Yours fuming, Ruth Pastry.


  MELDRUM FONSECA : UBER-TROMBONIST

  Eschewing the nose-flute, Meldrum Fonseca first took up the trombone at the age
  of seventy. Before this, his entire musical experience was limited to singing in
  the bath--or possibly singing in Bath, it is not quite clear. Having spent the best
  part of his life as a plinth magnate, Meldrum was a rich man. From Aleppo to Zug,
  few cities or towns exist without at least one plinth from the Fonseca Plinth Factory
  or one of its many franchised workshops dotted haphazardly around the globe.

  The conversation on that autumn day, under an overcast sky, went something like
  this. Meldrum''s paramour, Mrs Fonseca, asked him why he had never learned to play
  the trombone. This was a common verbal sally of hers, keeping Meldrum alert by firing
  questions at him which he had never been asked before. On the same day, for example,
  she asked him if he knew the slightest thing about the skeletal structure of badgers,
  and whether he could recommend a particular recording of a 19th century railway
  timetable being read aloud from cover to cover.

  Due to Mrs Fonseca''s constant mental prodding, Meldrum''s brain was a superb mechanism,
  thoroughly exercised, almost like a champion greyhound. Although often his answers
  to these constant questions might simply be "yes" or "no", his response to the trombone
  enquiry was "Well stap my chives, Marjorie-Suzanna, that''s a bloody good idea!
  I''m going to go out this very minute and buy myself a trombone!"

  And he did. He engaged a tutor on the same day, an unnerving milksop called Reynolds.
  Reynolds taught him daily for the next year, at which point Meldrum had become so
  adept that the tutor threw his hands in the air and said, in his weedy little voice,
  "Mr Fonseca, I can teach you no more! Your skills have outstripped my own!"

  From that day on, Meldrum spent most of his time standing next to a hedge by the
  ring road, playing his trombone and gladdening the hearts of all who passed him
  by.

  PREAMBLE TO A REPORT ON THE 26 LIGHTHOUSES OF HOON

  I am Cedric Spraingue, and I have inspected all the lighthouses of Hoon. This is
  my report. On the fourteenth of July, having had my crutches freshly varnished,
  I set out for the Port of Tongs, my knapsack packed with mustard cakes, celery stalks,
  a flask of slops, my notebook and pencil, several pins, a length of string, a wristwatch
  with a frayed strap, and many, many other things which at present I cannot divulge.

  I had to wait for three hours at the railway station, during which time I shunned
  the other human beings in the waiting-room, preferring to crouch in an alcove to
  jot down some prepatory notes for my tour of lighthouse inspection. There are twenty
  six lighthouses in Hoon, and rigorous planning would be necessary.

  I had decided to begin with the Port of Tongs lighthouse for three reasons:

  1. It is the lighthouse furthest from my home in Hooting Yard, being precisely forty
  six and a half motes distant. That figure has been verified--as have all the motages
  in my report--by Dobson''s bittern-robot measuring device. Each time I note the
  distance from one site to another, you may imagine this splendid metal bird soaring
  across the sky at unimaginable speed, its beak spewing forth ticker-tape.

  2. It is the oldest of the Hoon lighthouses by a good half-century.

  3. There is a toad hospital on the outskirts of the port, and Lillian, my toad,
  is sick. She has been struck by repeated fits of the chumpots, and I will be able
  to collect supplies of serum, paste, and toad-pills.

  The train journey was remarkably eventful. The guard''s van was struck by lightning.
  A pig wandered onto the track and missed death by seconds. A passenger, florid of
  face and decked out in clerical garb--a Jesuit perhaps--broke his ankle while attempting
  to step over a suitcase abandoned in the corridor. We suffered a temporary derailment.
  The toilets were flooded. Seven or eight handkerchiefs, donated by passengers, were
  needed to stem the ticket collector''s nosebleed. A small child frantic with mischief
  pulled the communication cord, causing a halt of some hours. Bacteria released from
  a mysterious package made all those in the rear carriage violently sick. A monomaniac
  with grubby fingernails walked up and down the length of the train declaiming his
  theories on colourless gases.

  There were other incidents, to be sure, but eventually the train arrived at the
  Port of Tongs. End of preamble.'
