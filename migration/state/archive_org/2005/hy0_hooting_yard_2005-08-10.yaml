full_text: 'IMPENDING JUXTAPOSITION OF BLUBBER AND TALLOW

  On Thursday next Mister Taplow will be presenting a talk at Sawdust Bridge Salvation
  Hall. He has made private arrangements to rent the building for the evening, so
  the usual manicuring session will not take place. Mister Taplow intends to discuss
  the relative merits of blubber and tallow, with specific reference to the manufacture
  of candles. Most of you will know that Mister Taplow is blind. The talk is scheduled
  to begin at 7.30 p.m., after which there will be an opportunity to ask questions,
  although Mister Taplow has indicated that he may not have time to answer more than
  a couple, as he will have to dash off, on horseback, to a mountainous retreat by
  9.45 p.m. The Trustees of Sawdust Bridge Salvation Hall have made arrangements for
  little snacks to be served to those attending, although no crockery will be provided.
  Mister Taplow''s guide dog, Agamemnon, will be on hand to gobble up any spillages,
  such as cake-crumbs. Agamemnon will not be accompanying his master to the mountains,
  so if anyone can provide the hound with a comfortable place to sleep for the night,
  that would be appreciated. Mister Taplow says he will collect the dog within six
  working days. Those who know Mister Taplow only from his talks on ostriches, fog,
  the brains of geese, shoe polish and Crosby Stills & Nash will, we hope, be pleasantly
  surprised by his erudition in what is, for him, a brand new topic. As ever, state
  of the art technology will be used to make a recording of the talk, for future release
  as a compact disc with a cover design by noted local mezzotintist Rex Tint. Please
  note that all those attending are asked to bring either a blubber candle or a tallow
  candle, but not both. Stewards will allocate seats on the night. The attic of Sawdust
  Bridge Salvation Hall is still infested with weird bird-like life-forms which screech
  horribly, but rest assured they are quite harmless. Tickets for this exciting event
  are available from all those kiosks clustered around the market square, or by post
  from Mister Taplow''s Exciting Talks, c/o Mister Taplow The Blind Man, The Strangely
  Mesmeric Building, Blister Lane.


  IT WAS DUSK

  It was dusk, and wantons had gathered in the spinney. Beyond the spinney, across
  the lake, was the running track where Bobnit Tivol had sprinted his way to immortality.
  The trackside, where once lupins had flamed forth, was now overgrown with charlock
  and bindweed and blackish darnel, clumps of which were thickest by the old well,
  where long, long ago the Woohoohoodywoo Woman had cast her spells. When they marked
  out the track back in 1934, they had forgotten about the well. They had forgotten
  about the hornets, too, and the wasps, and the bees, all of them drawn to the field
  for as long as anybody could remember, and never successfully exterminated. Even
  the sulphur bombs detonated by old Halob''s squad of flying insect killers failed.
  Back then, of course, old Halob was not yet old, but he had already cultivated a
  certain gravitas. Punctilio came to him later.

  Now the ghosts of old Halob and fictional sprint champion Bobnit Tivol haunt that
  long-abandoned athletics venue. That is why, at dusk, over in the spinney, the wantons
  gather. Dressed in flowing gowns stitched together from fire-damaged curtain material,
  the wantons descend upon the spinney armed with baskets of peppers and peapods and
  potatoes, brimming baskets from which the peppers and peapods and potatoes tumble
  and are strewn as the wantons skip along the path that leads to the spinney. No
  wanton stoops to pick up the fallen veg, as dusk falls, for they like to lay a trail.
  They make no secret of their gathering in the spinney across the lake from the ruined
  running track. All the townsfolk know they are heading there, at dusk on the third
  Thursday of each month, the skipping wantons with their baskets, but they are never
  followed. In the town, shutters are shut and lamps lit, and in their gloomy rooms
  the people switch on their radios, loud, and listen to dance band music of the golden
  age, and distract themselves with card games and charades, for they try not to think
  about the wantons in the spinney summoning up the ghosts of Bobnit Tivol and old
  Halob.

  By the running track itself, as dusk grows deeper, the hornets and bees and wasps
  no longer stir. They go wherever flying insects go at night, or they sleep, if such
  creatures sleep, in their nests, hidden in the brambles and the bindweed. Often
  the field that once saw Bobnit Tivol run round and round in record time is engulfed
  in mist. Why do the wantons gather in the spinney across the lake, instead of here?
  Before we find out, there are some blots to contend with.


  You have negotiated the blots, as a kayak negotiates rapids. Well done. Now we must
  discover why the wantons gather in the spinney. It is because they believe that
  phantoms are imbued with special powers if they are made to cross a body of water.
  The wantons want Bobnit Tivol and Halob, or their spirits, to materialise among
  the slumbering hornets and wasps and bees of the derelict running track, and then
  to pass over the still silent lake, and thus to come to them in the spinney. These
  athletic ghosts, empowered by water, will be given offerings of peppers and peapods
  and potatoes, and then the wantons will send them into the town, to do what the
  wantons want done. But nobody yet knows what the wantons want, for on no third Thursday
  have the ghosts come shimmering across the lake to them. No, the wantons wait all
  night, skipping while they wait, in circles, their gowns flowing, and at dawn they
  skip away from the spinney, their baskets empty, back into the town where radios
  still blare, where the shutters are still shut, into the dawn of another day when
  no one will speak the names of Halob or of Bobnit Tivol, not today nor evermore,
  for of course neither the wily trainer nor his protege ever existed in the first
  place, and if their ghosts do appear, it is only once a month, one misty night,
  in the wild minds of the wantons who skip in the spinney.


  WEATHERING THE STORM

  Sometimes I think it is very important to weather a storm. Too often, it is tempting
  to take the easy option, and not to weather it, but rather to succumb to it. Like
  you, I have been battered by gales in the past, and it is not a pretty sight. Stumbling
  out of a tempest with a dishevelled bouffant and wet clothing, I have taken refuge
  in the Loopy Copse Tea Rooms, ordered a plate of boiled peas and a cup of cocoa,
  wrung out my dripping hat, and averted my eyes, still stinging from the cold howling
  winds, from the other customers, who are dry and insouciant and faintly hostile.
  The contrast between the elegant Tea Rooms, with a harp, viola and piccolo trio
  playing in the corner, and the clattering storm outside, could not be greater. Well,
  it could be. The Tea Rooms are not quite heaven, and the tempest is not quite hell,
  but you should try pointing that out to the customers. I did just that, and I bear
  the psychic bruises to show for it.

  "There is no need to be so insouciant and faintly hostile," I said, to the room
  in general, as I slumped in my chair, and then I made the comparison just mentioned.
  A member of the Loopy Copse Tea Room staff glided over to me, smooth and silent,
  almost like a spectral being.

  "Excuse me, sir," she said, "But you slammed the door as you came in, there is a
  puddle of rainwater at your feet where you wrung out your hat, your bouffant is
  dishevelled and your clothing is wet. By taking refuge in here it is as if your
  very presence has brought the storm into the peaceable kingdom of our Tea Rooms."

  "I? The storm?", I shouted. She leaned to whisper into my ear.

  "Pause a moment and take the time to peer deeply into your soul," she said, "And
  it may become clear to you that there is much truth in my words. Now I am going
  to fetch your dish of boiled peas."

  "And cocoa?" I asked, but she had already flitted away. I noticed now that the other
  customers were staring at me. There were only four of them, sat together at a table,
  holding hands as if in a seance. The trio struck up a new tune, one I did not recognise.
  I made a sort of huffing noise and pretended to examine the menu, even though I
  had already ordered my snack. My thoughts were jumbled and incoherent. Was I the
  storm personified? Was the weather simply a projection of my inner being? Did I
  have unknown power over the elements? Was I a god?

  Suddenly the dish of boiled peas was placed before me. They were poisoned peas,
  or perhaps I should say enchanted peas, for after I had eaten them, piping hot,
  I was transported to an ethereal plane, where it seemed the universe was Loopy Copse
  Tea Rooms, and Loopy Copse Tea Rooms were the universe, eternal and illimitable.
  Somehow I knew that if I drank the cup of cocoa that was brought to me the spell,
  if spell it was, would be broken, so I let it grow cold. I put my hat on my head,
  paid my bill, and walked towards the door. Outside, the storm had died away.

  "Sky overcast, light drizzle, temperature mild growing colder towards evening,"
  I declared, and lo! it came to pass.


  THE AGONY IN THE GARDEN

  There was a man in my back garden and he was in agony. I am going to tell you why.
  This man had speared his foot with a garden fork. One of the very sharp tines of
  the fork had plunged through his boot and sock and foot and more sock and the sole
  of the boot and into the muck, forced downwards by the man''s other foot, or rather
  by the muscular power of his leg, bent at the knee. He was wearing a pair of butcher''s
  trousers, this man, but he was not a butcher. He was a clumsy thief, inexperienced
  in the use of gardening implements.

  It was the middle of the night, and there was no moon, or I should say the moon
  was hidden by monstrous black clouds, so it was very, very dark. Nonetheless, one
  would have thought the thief who clambered over a fence to steal things from my
  back garden would have carried a torch or some other means of illuminating his criminal
  intent. But not only was he a clumsy thief, he was a thief who lacked foresight.
  Because the day was still light when he set out from the hut o'' ne''er-do-wells
  where he lived, he seems to have assumed it would still be light when he approached
  the wooden fence which divides my back garden from the old muddy lane. But it was
  no longer light. I lived so far away from the hut that it took him hours and hours
  to reach my garden. His route was crooked and even convoluted, for he hugged the
  hedgerows and dared not stride across open fields, nor follow main roads, and nor
  did he risk using any of the public transport systems available, the pneumatic railways
  or the canal barges, for, being bent on crime, he did not wish to be seen.

  He may have been clumsy and lacking in foresight, but the man in my back garden
  whose foot was impaled by a fork was a master of stealth, I will give him that.
  In all the hours he skulked across the land, in his butcher''s trousers and pastry-maker''s
  jacket and Dusty Springfield hat, he was not seen by a single other living being,
  except for some cows in a field, and a passing goat, and attentive birds, and countless
  tiny things that creep and fly and hover and buzz, but none of these can speak,
  unlike human beings, who, had they seen the thief, might have denounced him to the
  police.


  A cow in a field

  For all his stealth, however, and irrespective of the cackhandedness of his fork-digging,
  the clumsy thief''s crime would never have succeeded. He had not made rigorous plans.
  Had he done so, he would have learned that I am a detective, whose tenacity in tracking
  down malefactors is legendary. One of the things that makes me so good at my job
  is the fact that I never sleep. As a child, at a fairground, on a hot September
  day, I toppled from the top of a helter skelter and landed on my head. I have never
  since then visited the Land of Nod. The metal plate in my skull is barely visible,
  and it has been one of the incidental pleasures of my life to amass a collection
  of strikingly colourful eyepatches.

  So it was that in the middle of the night, when all sensible people are fast asleep
  in their beds, I was wide awake. I can''t remember what I was doing, darning an
  eyepatch or sharpening a pencil, perhaps, or carrying out experiments on a badger.
  When I heard the telltale sounds of a wrongdoer climbing over the fence from the
  old muddy lane, I went over to the window. My working eye is a superb mechanism,
  and I watched as, in pitch darkness, the thief grabbed the fork from the pile of
  forks, searched the lawn for the big chalk X underneath which was buried the booty
  of the Blister Lane bank robberies, and with his very first fork-thrust, speared
  his foot, and howled. I promised to tell you how there came to be a man in my back
  garden, a man in agony, and now I have done so, and you can''t say fairer than that.


  THROUGH CLENCHED TEETH

  Through clenched teeth, in municipal yet verdant parkland, sprawled on grass, Blodgett
  recited the alphabet.

  "A is for vinegar," he grunted, "B is for worms, C is for villains swinging from
  the gallows..."

  A little voice inside Blodgett''s head told him to stop. He knew he had got it wrong
  again. He rolled himself down the gentle incline of the grass until he came to rest.
  Then he sat up and picked flecks of plant-life out of his hair. The sun was shining
  but the park was almost deserted. He peered across the green towards the choc ice
  tent, and licked his lips. Would he splash out on a choc ice? Blodgett fumbled in
  his pockets for change, but they were empty. He wondered if there was anybody in
  charge of the choc ice tent. Perhaps it, too, was deserted, and the choc ices were
  there for the taking. It was more likely that there would be some kind of automatic
  choc ice dispenser, but Blodgett knew he could jimmy it open with his jimmy. He
  recalled that he had left his jimmy at home, in a cupboard, with his empty yohoort
  cartons. Blodgett always pronounced "yogurt" as "yohoort", he was that kind of guy.
  He lay down again and closed his eyes and clenched his teeth and made yet another
  attempt at the alphabet.

  "A is for spinach, B is for the wildlife of the Great Lakes, C is for Pol Pot..."

  It was no use. Clambering to his feet, Blodgett ran across the green to the paddling
  pool. Though it was the height of summer, the pool had been drained. All the water
  had been collected in a sort of giant concrete bath located a few feet below ground,
  inaccessible to anyone who was not employed by the municipal park authorities. Had
  Blodgett known that several park-keepers were at that very moment enjoying frolics
  in the subterranean pool, he would have become angry, and had he become angry he
  would have tilted his head up and stared boldly at the sun, and let forth a stream
  of execrations, and the sun would have shrivelled up and died, such was the force
  of Blodgett''s inhuman rage.

  But Blodgett did not know about the underground paddling pool, nor of the antics
  taking place down there, so the sun was safe. He turned away and headed for the
  gate in the fence. He had decided to go to the docks, to watch the arrival and departure
  of gigantic container ships. It was Wednesday, and he was sure to see big boxes
  of bananas and bales of flax.


  BIRD RECOGNITION SKILLS

  The Hooting Yard Educational Outreach Hub announces a brand new correspondence course
  in Bird Recognition Skills, and not before time. As a taster, we are posting Module
  One on the site. Note that participants who successfully complete the entire course
  will be presented with an embossed certificate which gives full accreditation for
  entry to our upcoming courses on Advanced Bird Recognition Skills and Locust And
  Killer Bee Recognition Skills.

  Module One : The Beak

  A surefire method of deciding whether the animal you are looking at is a bird is
  to check whether it has a beak. If it has, then nine times out of ten it will be
  a bird. The beak--otherwise known as the bill--is the only device a bird has for
  consuming food. Birds have no teeth so they must swallow their food whole. A bird''s
  beak can vary in size and shape depending on the nature of their diet. Some birds
  such as falcons have evolved to have a cutting-type beak which allows them to tear
  through flesh with violent and blood-crazed savagery, whereas the hummingbird has
  a probe-like beak which allows it to drink the nectar from certain flowers, such
  as primroses, buttercups and elecampine, although you would be advised to check
  the accuracy of those examples in a botanical dictionary such as An Alphabetical
  Guide To What Every Infant Should Know About The Majesty Of Nature by Dobson.

  The beak is composed of an upper jaw called the maxilla, and a lower jaw called
  a mandible. From this the student can infer that all birds have two jaws. Remember
  that. Bird beaks are useful in other ways, for example woodcutters use theirs to
  cut wood, and parrots have sharp swivelled beaks to tear fruit, although their ripping
  and tearing is not quite as maniacal as those falcons mentioned earlier. Small mammals
  like hamsters and guinea pigs are quite safe from the average parrot, which is more
  likely to become ravenously ferocious in the presence of a grapefruit or a fig.
  Flamingos have long beaks to pull out fish from the water and ducks have flat beaks
  that allow them to retain all the fish and plants while draining out the water.

  Generally speaking, if it hasn''t got a beak, it is unlikely to be a bird. Try not
  to confuse a beak with a beaker, which is a drinks container like a mug or a tumbler,
  often but not always made of plastic, or with the Beaker People, which refers to
  an archaeological culture present in prehistoric Europe, defined by a pottery style--a
  beaker with a distinctive bell-shaped profile--that many archaeologists believe
  spread across the western part of the continent during the third millennium BC.
  If you have been paying attention you should be able to differentiate between those
  long-dead people and present-day birds.

  In closing, remember that although they can fly, locusts do not have beaks, therefore
  they are not birds.

  Sample questions:

  1. Complete the following sentence: That carbon-based living organism over there
  perched on a tree branch has a beak, so it must be a) a weasel, b) a big magnetic
  robot, c) a bird.

  2. Imagine you are living in the third millennium BC and you are holding a bell-shaped
  piece of pottery. Are you a) a member of the Beaker people, or b) a cassowary?

  3. Look at the two pictures below. Which one is a herring gull with a very sharp
  beak designed to attack you?


  Picture A, left, and Picture B, right. One of these is a herring gull.


  WITLESS FABIOLA

  Witless Fabiola is one of the archetypes in the complex mythology of the Tundists.
  Of the many stories about her, perhaps the most important is the legend in which
  she is sent out west on a Tundist quest to find a hornets'' nest but becomes distressed
  and sits down to rest, and while she rests she has a dream about a giant bream swimming
  in a stream lit by a moonbeam the colour of cream. In other tales, Witless Fabiola
  does deeds of derring-do, fights phantom crustacea in the tide pools of Tantarabim,
  wraps herself in flags, and--in an apocryphal story--turns into a zombie goddess
  who causes thunderstorms and blizzards and other meteorological phenomena.

  Witless Fabiola is usually depicted holding a trident in her left hand and some
  birdseed in her right, wearing a cape spun of crocus stalks, her left foot trampling
  on the neck of a subjugated cormorant. Sometimes she is given a human head, with
  a mop of frazzled black hair not unlike, say, Robert Smith''s of The Cure. In other
  images, inspired by the breakaway Pseudotundist sect, her head is that of a merganser
  duck or booby.

  Tundist scholar Ernesto Hudihudimojo has compiled an anthology of legends about
  Witless Fabiola, none of which is longer than a couple of hundred words, and all
  of which peter out quite irritatingly. The reader is desperate to know more, but
  Dr Hudihudimojo points to the authenticity of his retellings, and argues that one
  of the crucial features of Tundist myth is the eschewing of "closure".

  We asked the publishers for permission to reprint some of these stories, but they
  just grunted at our representative and sent her packing, pursued by fractious toddlers
  armed with pebbles.'
