full_text: "A THRILLING YARN\nI was invited to tour the sheds, so I wore a pair of\
  \ gloves.\nHave you got that so far? Sheds, gloves.\nThe snow was thick so we were\
  \ preceded by a snowplough the engine of which ran on a fuel of uncertain origin.\n\
  Sheds, gloves, snow, fuel. Make a note.\nWhen I say that the origin or provenance\
  \ of the fuel was uncertain, I mean that I did not know of it, not that it was unclear\
  \ to those people who know their snowploughs and other vehicles. Of course they\
  \ knew where their fuel came from. I did not need to know.\nSheds, gloves, snow,\
  \ fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles. Are you beginning to see where this leads?\n\
  As soon as we got inside the first shed on the tour I removed my gloves and put\
  \ them on a shelf above a gas heater. How they managed to pipe gas out here was\
  \ something else I did not know. We were meant to have a picnic in this first shed\
  \ but no one had remembered to bring the hamper.\nSheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs,\
  \ other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper.\nBursting with inhuman courage I volunteered\
  \ to return to the biddyhouse alone, to fetch the hamper. Various half-hearted attempts\
  \ were made to dissuade me, but I waved them aside with my now ungloved hands. It\
  \ has to be said that my waves were theatrical, even melodramatic, but I enjoyed\
  \ the sensation. I could feel my blood pumping through my veins.\nSheds, gloves,\
  \ snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic, hamper, biddyhouse,\
  \ waves, blood. Stop me when you've cottoned on.\nI left my gloves on the shelf\
  \ above the gas heater and went out into the snow. Without a compass, I strode off\
  \ in what proved to be completely the wrong direction. Instead of reaching the biddyhouse\
  \ where I would find the hamper and heave it on to my shoulder and take it back\
  \ to shed number one for the picnic, I found myself lost, and not only lost, but\
  \ encircled by wolves. The wolves each had a dusting of fresh snow on their backs.\
  \ I took this to mean that they had been standing around for a while, waiting for\
  \ me.\nSheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf, gas, picnic,\
  \ hamper, biddyhouse, waves, blood, compass, wolves.\nI counted seventeen snow-covered\
  \ wolves. They remained perfectly still, looking at me. Nursery rhymes are a godsend\
  \ in such circumstances, at least that has been my experience. I began with Ring\
  \ a ring a roses and then did Little Jack Horner. Not a single wolf moved a muscle.\
  \ It then dawned on me that they were all blind. Blind wolves in the snow! And me\
  \ lost, and without my gloves, and ignorant of fuel sources! And further than ever\
  \ from the picnic hamper! What a predicament! Or was it? You be the judge. Now listen,\
  \ just once more...\nSheds, gloves, snow, fuel, snowploughs, other vehicles, shelf,\
  \ gas, picnic, hamper, biddyhouse, waves, blood, compass, wolves, roses, muscles,\
  \ dawn, blind.\nAll should now be clear, as clear as the sky was on that cold bright\
  \ morning in September, forty miles north of Helsinki, the capital city of Finland,\
  \ founded as long ago as 1550 as a rival to the Hanseatic city of Tallinn.\n\nPABSTUS\
  \ TACK\nThis piece first appeared in September 2005.\nPabstus Tack, Pabstus Sludge,\
  \ Pabstus! Pabstus! Of him we sing. We sing his praises, it seems to me, for want\
  \ of anything better to do. Pabstus Tack sits on his great golden throne, belching\
  \ out light, a blinding light as gorgeous as it is uncanny. And yet it is an impure\
  \ light, that is certain, for with Pabstus Tack comes Pabstus Sludge. It is the\
  \ latter who is the source of those scarcely perceptible low booming noises, grave\
  \ and deep and sinister.\nWhen Pabstus! Pabstus! was installed on his throne there\
  \ was carnival and carousing. Fools danced around maypoles and jesting roisterers\
  \ roistered and doistered as if tomorrow would never come. No one has ever been\
  \ able to count the pies that were cooked that day. Many, many people drowned at\
  \ the swimming gala at the Old Crumbling Outdoor Pool, and ravens were seen hovering\
  \ in the sky. A post office person stuck pictures of Pabstus Tack to his hat and\
  \ was chased across the fields by happily screeching children. But was there a trace\
  \ of desperation in their screeching?\nAnd tomorrow did come, of course, as everyone\
  \ knew it had to. That was when the first rumbles were heard of Pabstus Sludge.\
  \ To appease him, the throne was moved to a higher point on the hill, just above\
  \ the coppice, where moles betrayed their presence in their usual mole-like way.\
  \ A gang from the tavern headed thither armed with rifles, until Pabstus! Pabstus!\
  \ made it known that moles were sacred and must never be harmed. Some say the men\
  \ turned their rifles on themselves in terror.\nTerror, it is said, is the only\
  \ proper response to Pabstus Tack and to Pabstus Sludge. Wrapped up tight in their\
  \ cardigans, hanging Tilly lamps from the rafters of their cabins, the braver villagers\
  \ plot his overthrow. Turnips are chewed. Cigarillos dangle from the soot-blackened\
  \ lips of the vanguard. Secret anthems, never written down, are mumbled rather than\
  \ sung. Food poisoning has wiped out most of these souls since Pabstus! Pabstus!\
  \ first emitted his light and his booms, seventeen years ago.\nThe throne has been\
  \ moved again, moved and reinforced. Now it is perched on a sort of concrete veranda\
  \ by the edge of a lake in which only puffy and bloated fish may swim. Larval creatures\
  \ are strewn on the shore, watched over by one of Pabstus Tack's lieutenants. The\
  \ air is thick, clotted, far too hot for this region. With each faint boom from\
  \ Pabstus Sludge, the shoreline creatures twitch. It is never dark here, thanks\
  \ to Pabstus Tack.\nBetween the lake and the coppice lies the village. A deranged\
  \ tangle of overhead wiring stretches beyond the horizon, supported on high wooden\
  \ poles which sway and creak in the constant wind. Nowadays children are no longer\
  \ taught to sing \"Pabstus Tack, Pabstus Sludge, Pabstus! Pabstus! made the wind\
  \ / Pabstus made it because we sinned\", but they should be. It is dangerous to\
  \ forget.\n\nMAX\nContinuing with correspondence received during Hooting Yard's\
  \ break, the estimable Max Decharne sent this:\nSome years back I bought an old\
  \ book called New Familiar and Progressive English and French Dialogues (With Dialogues\
  \ on Railway and Steamboat Travelling, and a Comparative Table of Monies and Measure)\
  \ by Richard and Quetin, published by Hachette, 1876, which I was recently looking\
  \ through again, and it remains one of the finest phrase books I've ever encountered.\n\
  Some of it sounds like the dialogue from a porn film: 'You oblige me in so willing\
  \ a manner, that it encourages me to apply to you again and again', 'I am delighted\
  \ that you make use of me so freely', 'You may dispose of me as you will', 'It is\
  \ impossible to do a favour in a more pleasing manner' 'I have never experienced\
  \ such satisfaction', 'I believe I shall go mad with pleasure'.\nThen there's the\
  \ section entitled 'To express horror and fright': 'It is abominable, horrid, infamous',\
  \ 'It is violating all that is most sacred in nature', 'It is enough to freeze one's\
  \ blood with horror', 'There never was anything seen so abominable', 'The mind revolts\
  \ from the idea of such a crime'.\nOr perhaps, when visiting those tourist spots\
  \ in Paris, and one feels the need to 'express dipleasure and grief': 'I am ruined\
  \ beyond remedy', 'My misfortunes are at their height', 'I am swallowed up with\
  \ affliction', 'After so many misfortunes, it only remains for me to die'.\nThen,\
  \ select phrases for when one chances upon Michael Howard: 'His babbling absolutely\
  \ splits my head', 'There is something repulsive in his address', 'It is difficult\
  \ for me to surmount the disgust with which he inspires me', 'Has he sworn to tease\
  \ us all day?'\nWhen training for a post in the Diplomatic Service, there's the\
  \ useful section headed 'of age and the different periods of life': 'Your aunt appears\
  \ very aged', 'His brother, who is younger than he, is quite decrepit', 'He is in\
  \ a state of extreme decay', 'He already has one foot in the grave'\nAnd, of course,\
  \ these random phrases which might come in useful among friends: 'What a quantity\
  \ of asparagus and artichokes!' 'My eldest sister had the whooping-cough, the youngest\
  \ had the measles, my eldest brother the small-pox, and the youngest a miliary fever',\
  \ 'Shall I help you to undress?', 'I will take charge of the bread and butter'.\n\
  Splendid stuff from Max, as ever. Even more correspondence tomorrow.\n\nDISPATCHES\
  \ FROM THE NIB OF VAN DONGELBRAACKE\nLo! In that year of torrential rainfall and\
  \ storm clouds I set out from the city carrying with me nought but a few rags. I\
  \ saw cows grazing, I heard horses whinnying. At the edges of farmyards I hid behind\
  \ hedges. My appearance was not one to encourage some cherry-cheeked farmer's wife\
  \ to invite me in for a dish of scrambled eggs. For days on end I ate nothing but\
  \ berries, or scraps of leftover cake from countryside wedding parties abandoned\
  \ in panic after visitations from extraterrestrial beings dressed up in glistening\
  \ metallic space-clothing and armed with laser guns. Everywhere I went I saw evidence\
  \ of burned-out barnyards and terrified geese. After roaming aimlessly for about\
  \ three months, I came to a city by the sea. I sat on a milestone and gazed at the\
  \ unfamiliar skyline. Some of the masts of ships docked in the harbour were taller\
  \ than the buildings. I fed a handful of crumbs to the goose that had been accompanying\
  \ me for the last few days, and patted its eternally bobbing head. \"Let us march\
  \ into that city and be bold!\" I announced to the goose, pointlessly, for it did\
  \ not understand a word of human language, being a goose. Nevertheless, it followed\
  \ me as I hoisted my bag of rags on to my back and strode towards the customs post\
  \ on the edge of the city. The weather was still tempestuous. I cannot count the\
  \ number of puddles I squelched through, nor how many squalls set that little goose\
  \ a-jitter. The customs post, when at last we lumbered up to it, was deserted, but\
  \ for a man of great illness lying sprawled on a pallet, whose moans took only moments\
  \ to irritate me. Indeed, the sound of human whining, after months of solitude,\
  \ set my teeth on edge to such an extent that I bid the goose stifle him as best\
  \ it could. The goose sat on the sick man's head while I rifled through the filing\
  \ cabinets. It was at this precise moment that the press photographer bounded through\
  \ the door and took snaps of the scene which will be familiar to you. Startled by\
  \ camera flashes, the goose fled. I backed against the wall, ragged and, I must\
  \ confess, wild-eyed. The sick man was transmogrified. Only now did I become aware\
  \ of his police uniform, as he and the photographer exchanged a glance that conveyed\
  \ some terrible significance. That is why I am writing to you from a prison cell.\
  \ Thus far I have fed my interrogators a pack of lies, but I do not know how much\
  \ longer I can hold out. Please, please, my darling, try as best you can to smuggle\
  \ in a package of sellotape, soap, bleach, some pins, a map and a bale of plastic\
  \ sheeting so that I can make good my escape!\nSource : Letters From Prison by Joost\
  \ Van Dongelbraacke\n\nHOW TO THINK OF THINGS OTHER THAN JUGGLING\nThis is a splendid\
  \ exercise first developed by brain guru Dennis Beerpint, brother of the poet Gervase\
  \ Beerpint (see 3rd February). Go to a field. Attaching clamps to slats with quarter-inch\
  \ gulliver bolts, smear some lattice-work with a decoction of binding-agents and\
  \ thread the netting through tin clips, then dislodge the hasp on the paddle in\
  \ order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges, which should be arranged\
  \ in rotation beside colour-coded pails, the white one being strapped to a clogged\
  \ bracket, the red one spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held in place\
  \ by rubber frets, and the black one chiming against the aluminium knob on the wicket,\
  \ which is fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled by a\
  \ clay handle on the bole, against which pellets are fired at pre-arranged intervals\
  \ by the steam gun just below the fourth set of nozzles, cleverly positioned at\
  \ such a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases\
  \ to pass over the tarpaulin, in which punctures have been made to allow ease of\
  \ passage for the andiron tubes carrying ballbearings to the spandrel and thus on\
  \ to the rotating wooden platform, upon which the greased hinges chafe against the\
  \ pulleys sufficiently for the sparks to ignite sulphur bombs inside the bakelite\
  \ carriage, without endangering the pads, bulbs and chocks on the hooter, at the\
  \ sounding of which the intricately-wired snares snap shut and entrap the oiled\
  \ plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting the recurrent biting movements of\
  \ the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of todge into the motor around which you\
  \ will have placed canvas bags packed with candles in order to steady the persistent\
  \ rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron sledge underneath the trolley carrying\
  \ the double battery-powered hammer which serves to agitate the drum containing\
  \ the four-inch blades detached from the rusted bowl of the compass, held in place\
  \ on the rocket by a monstrous titanium screw wedged against the plackets of the\
  \ grit distributor, customised by locking its gut probes into position with no less\
  \ than twenty six separate multiple-gate plugs, on each of which a scorched zinc\
  \ disc swivels in response to the magnetic properties of the special basin receiving\
  \ the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out of the glass globe tethered\
  \ to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains which run parallel to\
  \ the lengths of string tied at one end to the pirate's aureole and at the other\
  \ to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags stolen from the same warehouse\
  \ which provided the hooks for the plank balanced uneasily across the gap between\
  \ the pinboard and the hodometer fitted with small beeswax parcels lashed to the\
  \ crane from which dangle several springs and coils loaded with lead weights and\
  \ enamelled cubes the purpose of which becomes apparent when the gleaming cork is\
  \ plunged into the canister of boiling duckpond water kept at constant temperature\
  \ by hastily-repaired piping fed by siphons and buttressed by giant prongs from\
  \ the surfaces of which have been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the\
  \ use of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the derrick next to the pumps\
  \ on the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material\
  \ as a sop to the git who provided the jars, flakes and asbestos-free wing cranks\
  \ you will require for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism\
  \ moulded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged from a manufacturer of resins whose\
  \ grotesque sponge hood has been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium\
  \ tripod atop which lurks a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic\
  \ pan containing phosphorus hoops and a glamorous leather trumpet pitched towards\
  \ a cobalt beaker lit up by the Mackenzie Beam angled obliquely next to a yellow\
  \ fustian canopy covering a massive trellis to which are glued an up-ended cone\
  \ of polythene veiled by cotton-wool wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller\
  \ caked in mercury powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub countersunk\
  \ behind the crust of a feather on a stool with pins affixed to the leaching grille\
  \ placed askew atop the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Now stand back and\
  \ count to a hundred. You will have forgotten all about juggling.\n\nKING WENCESLAS\n\
  \nOver at the super soaraway Dabbler there is a traditional Christmas story in Key's\
  \ cupboard.\n\n\"THE KAM, AS IF APPROACHING THE YARTA...\"\n\"The kam, as if approaching\
  \ the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence, bows, brings his drum up to his\
  \ forehead, and says, 'Mergu! mergu!' Then he declares whence and why he comes.\
  \ Suddenly he shouts; this is meant to indicate that Erlik is angry that a mortal\
  \ should dare to enter his yurta. The frightened kam leaps backward towards the\
  \ door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Erlik's throne. After this\
  \ performance has been gone through three times, Erlik speaks: 'Winged creatures\
  \ cannot fly hither, beings with bones cannot come: how have you, ill-smelling black\
  \ beetle, made your way to my abode?'\" -- M. A. Czaplicka, Shamanism In Siberia\n\
  \nON WHY I SHOULD BE THE NEXT DIRECTOR GENERAL OF THE BBC\nHaving let the Archbishopric\
  \ of Canterbury slip through my fingers, I am not going to make the same mistake\
  \ with the other big job now unexpectedly on offer. George Entwistle's resignation\
  \ after just fifty-four days at the helm means the post of BBC Director General\
  \ is vacant. As Leonard Cohen put it, \"I'm your man\".\nThe present BBC is a huge\
  \ and bloated organisation, preposterously so when we consider what it does. The\
  \ clue is in the name: British Broadcasting Corporation. It broadcasts programmes\
  \ on the telly and the radio. That's all. So let us gain some perspective. It is\
  \ not governing a country or fighting a war or sending a mission to Mars. (Someone\
  \ on the Today programme this morning did refer to the imminent \"Star Trek world\
  \ of the 2020s\", but that is a topic for a separate postage.)\nI have no idea what\
  \ all those hopeless hapless BBC-lifer nonentities in the seemingly numberless tiers\
  \ of management actually do, and nor, I suspect, in their heart of hearts, do they.\
  \ I would immediately dispense with the lot of them. Do you know how ResonanceFM\
  \ is run? There is a benevolent dictator, assisted by one person who knows how all\
  \ the technical gubbins works and one person who makes sure they have enough programmes\
  \ to fill the schedule. And that's it. The BBC could easily be run on the same lines,\
  \ perhaps doubling up on the numbers of assistants to reflect that there is a TV\
  \ arm as well as a radio one.\nNow let us look in more detail at each of those.\n\
  Television. I don't know if you have read a tabloid newspaper recently. I have,\
  \ and I can tell you that a terrifying percentage of the content is related directly\
  \ to television. If you removed the TV-related stuff from the average tabloid you\
  \ would be left with a few flimsy pages. I think what this shows is that television\
  \ has had a lethal and degrading effect on the culture of the masses. Truly we live\
  \ in an age of pap. So my first instinct would be to shut down the television service\
  \ entirely. That, however, is probably an impossible dream, even for as dictatorial\
  \ a Director General as I intend to be. What would be feasible, however, is to scrap\
  \ all the current programming and show only Key-approved content. Call it elitism,\
  \ if you will, but I know I know best, and I am sure after a short while everyone\
  \ else will agree.\nThus, for example, if you had a choice between hour upon hour\
  \ of Celebrity Antique Cookery Car Jungle Challenge or a season of classic Googie\
  \ Withers films, which would you prefer? Not that you will be given the choice under\
  \ my dominion. It will be Googie all the way, every day! And when we have exhausted\
  \ the Googie canon we will show all of Jacques Rivette's films, and then Guy Maddin's,\
  \ on rotation. There are of course other approved film persons other than Googie\
  \ and Jacques and Guy, and they will get their slots.\nBut oi!, I hear you cry,\
  \ that is cinema, not television. Television is a separate and distinct medium in\
  \ its own right. To which I reply, maybe so, but there needs to be a moratorium\
  \ while we bash some sense back into the heads of the masses. After, say, ten years\
  \ of my limited schedule, it might be possible to reintroduce certain made-for-television\
  \ programmes, chiefly Scandinavian police dramas and a show dedicated entirely to\
  \ Dr Alan Statham from Green Wing.\nRadio. I mentioned ResonanceFM above, and it\
  \ seems to me the best thing to do is simply to adjust the current BBC wavelengths\
  \ so they broadcast Resonance instead. This would do wonders for the nation's morale.\
  \ As I would be in charge, there would of course be a channel dedicated wholly to\
  \ Hooting Yard On The Air. There are already hundreds of hours' worth of me babbling\
  \ into a microphone available as podcasts, so these could be put on an ever-repeating\
  \ loop.\nI would, however, retain two programmes from the current BBC schedules,\
  \ the shipping forecast and Farming Today. For the latter, the existing roster of\
  \ presenters would be ditched (ha ha!) and replaced by some proper peasants.\nOther\
  \ Activities. BBC persons witter on at length about a multi-platform approach. Basically,\
  \ all this means is making the TV and radio programmes available on computers and\
  \ laptops and iFaffs and other digital devices. All you need is a computer-literate\
  \ teenperson to sort that out.\nMy finest achievement, however, would be to resurrect\
  \ The Listener. Younger readers may be unaware that from 1929 to 1991 the BBC published\
  \ the best weekly periodical I have ever read. It was an intelligent general interest\
  \ magazine of the kind now absent from our newsagents' shelves. (Both The Spectator\
  \ and The New Statesman have a political axe to grind; The Listener didn't.) As\
  \ a teenperson, I used to read it every week from cover to cover, and learned more\
  \ from it than from any other single source. I knew the rot had set in when it was\
  \ closed down two decades ago, a decision I can still not forgive.\n\nIt is clear\
  \ from the above that I am the best possible Director General the BBC could possibly\
  \ have. I await \"Lord\" Patten's call (assuming he is still in post at the BBC\
  \ Trust when you read this. If not, I'll take his job too, and I won't need ennobling.)\n\
  \nTILES\nJust back from seeing a splendid set of Delft tiles on display in a house\
  \ in Spitalfields. You can see more here.\n\n\nON THE KRUMMHORN MAN\nHere comes\
  \ the Krummhorn Man.\n  He's had a palaver.\n  He has to solve acrostics for his\
  \ mother.\n  She is blind, and so is her dog.\n  The dog's name is Spinach.\n  Spinach\
  \ is a good name for a dog.\n  That's what mother thinks.\n  She is ninety now,\
  \ and every domestic pet she has ever had since she was a tiny tot she has called\
  \ Spinach.\n  The donkey, the hamster, a kitten, several goldfish, certain other\
  \ types of fish, rabbits and budgerigars, all Spinaches.\n  This might be called\
  \ monomania.\n  The Krummhorn Man looks kindly upon his mother.\n  He is a good\
  \ son.\nTake a look at him now, a shopping list scrunched in his fist, prancing\
  \ up the street.\n  He is on his way to the butcher's.\n  The butcher is a caution.\n\
  \  He's Cyclopean and bears duelling scars.\n  Lit by the moon, he howls, a proper\
  \ butcher's howl.\n  He keeps a vase of peonies on his mantel.\n  Oh for campions\
  \ and oxlips!\n  Today it is sausages for the Krummhorn Man.\n  The sausages have\
  \ the name of an English county.\n  The butcher, the butcher, the butcher with his\
  \ meat-cleaver.\n  How sharp it is, and fearsome.\n  He whets the blade on a whetstone\
  \ behind his kiosk.\n  You can hear the scree scree scree before dawn.\n  He wakes\
  \ the town.\nSausages bought, on goes the Krummhorn Man, past the haberdasher and\
  \ the aquarium.\n  Past all things.\n  Out into the gorse and nettles, followed\
  \ by geese.\n  Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin.\n  But he is not pied and he has\
  \ no pipe and it is not Hamelin.\n  It is an English county with the same name as\
  \ the sausages.\n  Or it might be, if things fit neatly together.\n  He pops a boiled\
  \ sweet into his mouth.\n  It is a spangle.\n  Invisible threads bind him to the\
  \ past.\n  He smacks his lips.\n  The sound alerts an otter.\n  The Krummhorn Man\
  \ shook off the geese and now he has an otter.\n  He sits down by the river.\n \
  \ He has to solve acrostics for his mother.\nThe wind is fair, the wind is foul.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man throws in the towel.\n  It is carried downstream towards the\
  \ sea.\n  The otter follows him back to mother.\n  Dog and otter in mother's parlour.\n\
  \  The one blind, the other not.\n  What a palaver.\nUmbilically linked as once\
  \ he was he makes a pot of tea.\n  He ties a knot in a dishcloth and chucks it out\
  \ of the window.\n  And here comes Mister Snippage, toiling along the lane.\n  He\
  \ is lame and pale and valiant.\n  What ho, what ho.\n  And tally tally ho too.\n\
  \  Then the Krummhorn Man makes himself scarce.\n  He takes himself to a place of\
  \ defeat.\n  He leaves the sausages on the kitchen counter.\nWhere would he be if\
  \ he were not here?\n  Over the sea and in a capital city loud with life.\n  Churning\
  \ up the churnable, sparks and pangs, wearing a hat at a jaunty angle, getting into\
  \ tangles, bumping things.\n  He peers into the distance through the mist.\n  The\
  \ glue factory has closed down.\n  He keeps one arm in a sling for old time's sake.\n\
  \  He was once the invalids' invalid, just as the butcher is the butchers' butcher.\n\
  \  It says so on a sign on his wall.\n  There is a red wax seal embossed on it of\
  \ heraldic significance.\n  Red wax too in the Krummhorn Man's hair.\n  A barber\
  \ put it there for a prank.\n  Little gobbets, tiny orbs.\n  He is a very peculiar\
  \ barber, shunned by many, and that is no surprise.\n  The barber is down a way\
  \ from the butcher and the haberdasher and the aquarium, and around a corner, ever\
  \ in shadow.\n  It is where they hold table-rapping meetings, with ectoplasm.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man sought his father there.\n  He is a good son.\nHedges flank\
  \ the abandoned glue factory.\n  They have not been snipped for many a spring.\n\
  \  It is a place to pine.\n  There are still nozzles to be seen among the ruins.\n\
  \  The Krummhorn Man has his favourites.\n  He has snapped thousands of photographs\
  \ with a long lens.\n  He used to use a Polaroid.\n  Polaroids and polar bears and\
  \ polar wastes, he kept them together in his head.\n  It was a nice head, mother\
  \ said.\n  It was the colour of curd.\n  The otter was gone from the parlour when\
  \ he went back, bent on his sausages.\n  The fat sizzled in the pan.\nJust then\
  \ Mister Snippage came toiling back along the lane and began to pound on the door\
  \ with his great hairy fists.\n  Spinach dragged his ancient canine bones to the\
  \ doormat and dribbled.\n  At the same time the telephone rang and an alarm sounded.\n\
  \  It was pandaemonium.\n  The hospital helicopter was circling overhead.\n  There\
  \ was gunfire coming from the hills.\n  It turned out to be a mock emergency, staged\
  \ by actors.\n  Even Mister Snippage was not really Mister Snippage at all.\n  His\
  \ part was played by an elfin amateur caked in makeup.\n  The sausages were burned\
  \ black.\nSee, see, the Krummhorn Man has set out again, in the rain, in the rain.\n\
  \  This time he has taken a pipe.\n  Its bowl is in the lee of the brim of his hat\
  \ so the rain does not douse it.\n  But the shutters are down at the butcher's shop.\n\
  \  The butcher is gone for the day.\n  Where is he gone to?\n  That is what everyone\
  \ is asking, in a huddle at his door.\n  Then the band strikes up that old traditional\

  \ Over at The Dabbler, I remember him in a version of a piece first posted here\
  \ three years ago.\n\nUNHINGED BY CREAM CRACKERS\nDear Mr Key, writes Poppy Nisbet,\
  \ I have been commissioned to write a book entitled Fifty Anecdotes About Cream\
  \ Crackers, and to date I have managed to find only two true life cream cracker-related\
  \ stories which are even mildly entertaining. In your piece on the cardboard sign\
  \ \"Depressed Horse Never Knew Saucepans\" you write \"It was not the cream crackers\
  \ which unhinged me, as they have done before.\" I would be very interested to know\
  \ about the earlier unhingement to which you allude, as it could provide invaluable\
  \ material for my book.\nWell, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, I am happy to oblige,\
  \ as they used to sing in the old folk song \"Poppy Nisbet\". To ensure my reply\
  \ is as helpful as possible, I consulted my papers to winkle out each and every\
  \ cream cracker unhingement reference, and I find that there is not just the one\
  \ incident to report, but several.\nBefore going into any detail I think it is important\
  \ to point out that in these unhingements there is no connection whatsoever, in\
  \ either a literal or legal or moral or incoherent sense, between the snackfood\
  \ treat commonly known as a cream cracker (a sort of glorified water biscuit) and\
  \ the use of the word \"crackers\" as a euphemism for mad, crazy, nuts, insane,\
  \ deranged, bedizened, or, indeed, unhinged. I am glad we have cleared that one\
  \ up at the outset. I know from experience that all sorts of misunderstandings can\
  \ occur when readers think that there is a link, either fearsomely strong, as with\
  \ an iron chain, or more fragile, as with a gossamer thread, between the snackfood\
  \ and the mental or emotional condition. That there can be such a link, I do not\
  \ deny. Consider for example the case of the German railway sleeping car attendant\
  \ Ravilious, who was driven crackers by crackers by dint of the word association,\
  \ just as, later, he was to suffer abasement in a basement and to be abused on a\
  \ bus--though what he was doing aboard a bus, when loyalty ought to have limited\
  \ his mode of travel to the German railway system, is a mystery. Not an ineffable\
  \ one, perhaps, such as the nature of God or the alignment of certain tree clumps,\
  \ but a mystery nevertheless, and one which you, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, may\
  \ wish to investigate when you have finished writing Fifty Anecdotes About Cream\
  \ Crackers, assuming of course you do finish writing it, and do not simply abandon\
  \ the project through lassitude, blockage, or persistent cramp.\nIf you do abandon\
  \ the book, one excuse you will not have is a lack of material, because I see, on\
  \ looking through my papers, that I can furnish you with no fewer than forty-seven\
  \ cream cracker unhingement yarns. As you already have two in the bag, as you say,\
  \ then you need find only one more to tot up the anecdote-count to a half-century,\
  \ and, foof-la!, there is your book, done and dusted.\nI realise it may beggar belief\
  \ that one man can lay claim to forty-seven separate episodes of unhingement by\
  \ cream cracker, but I insist that I speak the truth. After all, for what possible\
  \ reason would I lie to you, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet? I am unlikely to benefit\
  \ from having my anecdotes retailed, in your book, presumably under cover of anonymity,\
  \ an anonymity I will wish to preserve for insurance purposes. In fact I would suggest\
  \ that you invent forty-seven different fictional characters to act as the supposed\
  \ protagonists of the events to which I shall make you privy. You can be quite explicit\
  \ about such a manoeuvre, by which I mean you need not pull the wool over your readers'\
  \ eyes by pretending that, say, Mr X or Ms Y or Dr Z stand in for three different\
  \ \"real\" people. You may want to make it blatantly obvious that you are using\
  \ made-up names by co-opting forty-seven fictional characters who already exist,\
  \ invented by others, as I did when writing my as yet unpublished manuscript Forty-Seven\
  \ Lightly Fictionalised Accounts Of Ineffably Mysterious Tree Clump Alignment Shenanigans.\
  \ The true life heroes and heroines of these tales are disguised by obviously fictional\
  \ names: Emma Bovary, Martin Chuzzlewit, Tyrone Slothrop, Peason, Josef Bong, Raskolnikov,\
  \ Winnie Verloc, Lupin Pooter, Dolores Haze, Ravelstein, Arturo Ui, Winston Smith,\
  \ Grimes, Pinkie Brown, Geoffrey Firmin, Steerpike, Pointsman, Grabber, Myra Breckinridge,\
  \ Molloy, Pangloss, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Roger Thornhill, Guy Secretan, Ilya Kuryakin,\
  \ Clare Quilty, Lemuel Gulliver, Doctor Slop, Sara Lund, Inspector Truscott, Ned\
  \ Stark, Cissie Colpitts, Sebastian Dangerfield, Giles De'Ath, Ronnie Bostock, Ebin\
  \ Willoweed, Hans Gruber, Wendy Hale, Chance Hale, Watt, Prince Zaleski, Roger Ackroyd,\
  \ Evadne Mount, Arthur Gordon Pym, De Selby, Mike Hammer, and the man with the twisted\
  \ lip. You are quite welcome to use the very same pseudonyms in your forty-seven\
  \ accounts of my cream cracker unhingements, although you may of course wish to\
  \ pick your own, or even make them up entire out of whole cloth, if that is the\
  \ kind of thing you like to do, when fighting off lassitude, blockage, and persistent\
  \ cramps. I know I do.\nEarlier I described cream crackers as glorified water biscuits.\
  \ It may be of interest to you, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, that, when looking through\
  \ my papers, in addition to records of forty-seven unhingements by cream cracker,\
  \ I came upon no fewer than fifty-three derangements by water biscuit. Yes, yes,\
  \ I know, that too beggars belief, but there you go. I can only speak as I find.\
  \ It occurs to me that if, in spite of all, you are unable to come up with a fiftieth\
  \ anecdote for your cream cracker tally, you could renegotiate the deal with your\
  \ publisher and instead give them Fifty Anecdotes About Water Biscuits. I have all\
  \ the material you will need, and instead of having to root around desperately trying\
  \ to track down a fiftieth diverting and entertaining and instructive cream cracker\
  \ story, you would simply have to discard three of my water biscuit tales. Alternatively,\
  \ I could do that for you, sending you just the fifty you need, each one guaranteed\
  \ to be a full and true account of an occasion on which, for a variety of reasons,\
  \ I underwent a spell of derangement due to a water biscuit, or in some cases water\
  \ biscuits plural. That is the kind of stuff which I think would make any publisher\
  \ happy, or at least any publisher worth his salt.\nI am not going to digress upon\
  \ the salt content, or lack of it, in cream crackers and/or water biscuits, as that\
  \ way madness lies, or, if not madness, then at the very least unhingement or derangement,\
  \ as I know to my cost.\nSo, Poppy Nisbet, Poppy Nisbet, let me know by return of\
  \ post which road you wish to go down, the Avenue De Cream Crackers or the Boulevard\
  \ Du Water Biscuits. I will then send you a very lengthy screed, which you may fillet\
  \ or primp, as you so wish."
