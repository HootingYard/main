full_text: 'ONCE UPON A TIME

  You dressed so fine. You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn''t you? Well
  no, you didn''t. You should have. Mister Compton at the Tweezer Factory told you
  to, but you ignored him. You did worse than ignore him. You tipped his hat off his
  head and trod on it until it was crushed. And what did you do then? You kicked the
  crushed hat into the gutter, with a sneer on your lips. And, oh! how that sneer
  disfigured your face. It was an ugly sneer, and made of you an ugly person, something
  nobody had recognised until then. You, who had won the hearts of a multitude through
  your good works in the field of bird welfare, you who had cradled crows in your
  arms, who had nursed an injured starling through three long days and nights, who
  had fed droplets of rainwater to a hummingbird, who so delicately brushed the feathers
  of an ostrich which had food poisoning, you whose eyes lit up with glee when a flock
  of little bitterns soared across the blue, blue sky, you--the so-called "Cassowary
  Man"... for you to betray the faith so many had in you, to reveal your sinful heart
  by kicking Mister Compton''s crushed hat into the gutter, and not just any gutter,
  but a foul, filthy, stinking gutter, greasy with slime... for you to do that shocked
  us all. Now you languish in a prison cell, accused of feckless acts and nincompoopery,
  and Mister Compton lies buried in a distant windswept graveyard. Oh Cassowary Man,
  Cassowary Man... we can never forgive you.


  LIFE AND LOVES OF THE IMMERSION MAN

  The man with the hammers, the man with the flags. He has a second pair of shoes.
  He bought them in Blister Lane, he had them repaired. His head is the same size
  as two of anyone else''s head, or a few pounds of oranges, plums, or other fruit.
  It will take years. Once he had decided to paint his ship with stolen paint, he
  could not look back. The ship, when painted, would be burnt sienna in colour, stains
  apart. What a long ship it was, and is, and will be. It had sailed from shore to
  shore. He held sway at the helm, and on deck. He spat plum stones into his flask.
  Much later, he knew, they would be crushed, liquefied, in his blender, in his kitchen,
  in his other hut, the hut he had built at the docks, for those mornings when he
  did not set sail on his ship to reach some other shore, where he had other huts.
  In weather so suitable for breakfast on a lawn, eighteen bowls of Special K and
  a jellied, jellied eel, he would ram the oars home, force them into the muck, so
  they were perpendicular, not far away from the tallest of the six trees, which were
  poplars, or larches, or even yews. Oars fixed in place, he will paint them, the
  oars, with the delicate bristles of his Coddington brush. Its wooden handle has
  seen better days, particularly the days in Jutland, Scheveningen, Reykjavik, other
  landmarks of or near Scandinavia. Those were the days before he was pulled towards
  the seas. Who pulled him to the seas? Who made his flag? Who made his shoes? Ah,
  that I cannot say, not yet. The kettle maps were stacked in a rough wooden crate.
  The crate had been painted. Butter had been kept in this crate, butter used in the
  sandwiches he had eaten at half-time in all those polevaulting or archery competitions
  he had entered. They had struck a medal for him, he was so keen. He had lost the
  medal. It was zinc. It had fallen out of his pocket in March. Deep snow lay on the
  ground. He remembered the day well, because he had to, it was Potato Day! The village
  wrestler, the one with the goitre, had a big iron pot of gruel and slops, as he
  always did. No one knew how old he was, but his birthday parties were marked by
  rectitude and spasms. He was extremely tall, he had to stoop to enter his own house.
  It was a squalid house. It stank of vinegar. This wrestler was wont to sing remarkable
  songs as he sat on the jetty, dangling his feet in the brackish water. For many
  years he had tended his broken nose, applying a new set of bandages every day. He
  used bright red bandages, having smeared them first with ink or ointment. The bottles
  were identical, and kept on the same shelf. The shelf was made of plastic, but it
  sloped towards the left. Nothing heavier than two small bottles or some corks could
  be kept on it. He brushed his hair. The lake was hidden by trees, a mile away from
  Haemoglobin Towers. For a thousand years, the lake looked blue. One day, when he
  was famished, he swam there, he wore water-wings, rubber ones, and yellow. He had
  to inflate them with his perfumed breath. It took all morning. By noon he was exhausted.
  Later, stealthily, he crept by torchlight to the moorings. They had been varnished,
  so thoroughly that he slipped and fell. No bones were broken. But Pang Hill was
  no longer his home, nor could it ever be so, not while he wore such preposterous
  trousers. Eating jam by the spoonful, he watched the branch give way. It fell to
  the ground. He was wearing tiny sandals, three sizes too small. The stitching was
  coming loose on both of them, and not before time. The man with the clarinets had
  arrived. He sprang to his feet, on legs. They mucked about with each other''s pencil
  sharpeners all day. An ailing vulture circled overhead. It had splendid musculature,
  or thought it did. Below, on the pebbles, they donned skindiving equipment. The
  pub was shut. The landlord had rouge ears underneath his hair. He carried a selection
  of bats, pails, needles and vicuna nets. These he patted with yearning. His one
  foot was shod in an enemy''s shoe. A token of combat. It had a vulgar reek, but
  squashed ants and earwigs on the paving slabs with the best of them. This was called
  HACK-SLOT B. It meant so much, or it meant nothing, he was not sure. Long ago he
  had become entangled in the waterlogged corridors of the Big Damp Building, and
  now there was no escape. The magnificence of it was breathtaking. It had taken centuries
  to build, but only last year was the tin bath warehouse added on. He spat in it,
  and kept on spitting, he was unable to stop himself. Feathers sprouted, but did
  not grow. They were spindly and vicious. He could no longer remember how to speak
  Hungarian, if he ever knew. His boxer shorts were blue, from Budapest. There is
  a reason for everything, but not for food. Food must be speared with big tin forks.
  Or so he thought. He poked at the plankton with his fork. The plate had been smashed,
  it was in bits on the linoleum. He intended to take up athletics. They would wrap
  him in flowers and other greenery, and all because he had ruined his crayons when
  he was a tot. He was wicked, wicked, and he went on a cruise. The cruise took him
  north. Then it took him west. He was not sure which coinage to use. He had some
  change in his little pockets. It weighed so much, he had to trudge. After careful
  planning, he set fire to all the maps. He put the cartons to one side. They would
  be useful to him later on, if at all. But it was time to hold a grudge. He lighted
  upon a fishmonger, and rapped him on the nose with a fountain pen. Maroon ink spurted
  out on to the fishmonger''s mouth and chin. He had lockjaw and some pianos. Where
  did he keep his pianos? They sent a detective to find out. One day, he would brandish
  despicable wooden things inside his tent. It was a famous tent, but age had frayed
  it. It was decorated with a boa constrictor motif, lacquered in mauve. He came upon
  it on a mountain top, he hurled it into a sand pit. His skull was perfectly formed
  and bright blue. There had been much talk of this in thousands of corridors and
  on horseback. All the fruit had been chewed. He checked his dictionary for errors.
  Under B he found plenty. He pasted them up, threw back his head, extricated some
  tacks from the hardboard, and shoved them into an envelope. This was stylish. He
  sat by the big clock. His sister arrived. She was an emigree. She buried three or
  four pelicans or yaks near a factory. That had to be the factory. This must be an
  ambulance! Its bleepers are off-pitch and ungodly. Bundled inside a blanket, she
  sported a mask, half of it carved out of mahogany and the rest out of something
  metallic. Delicate traceries of bip lay smeared on the gasworks, for this was Raymond''s
  village. His dubbin was better than the rest. He had come this far, and had no sandwiches
  left. He was in agony. Darning the beekeeping outfit had been no laughing matter.
  The reek of sandalwood and lavender was in the air. He was penniless. Wearing an
  altimeter instead of a wristwatch, he careered along the towpath of the canal. The
  Immersion Man was on his way.


  DOBSON''S LEECH MISHAP

  Dobson was one of the few pamphleteeers of the 20th century who still took seriously
  the mediaeval theory of the Four Bodily Humours. To remind readers who have forgotten,
  and inform those who don''t know, here is a commendably concise paragraph from "Humorous"
  Dobson, an unpublished essay by Marigold Chew:

  Taking the Aristotelian elements in turn, the theory was as follows: earth is reflected
  in the body as black bile, air as yellow bile, fire as blood, and water as phlegm.
  From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. Dobson
  never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally correct. He tended
  towards melancholy.

  And, it should be said, he was so convinced that he also subscribed to the related
  practice of bloodletting with leeches. Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he
  had a devil of a time trying to find a doctor who would treat him as he wished.
  On his 61st birthday, suffering from an excess of black bile, he was in luck--or
  so he thought. An "alternative therapist" had opened their doors just down the road.
  Dobson presented himself and demanded leeching. He was shown into a back room and
  lo!, leeches were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches
  of the genus Helobdella (Glossiphoniidae), rather than Hirudo medicinalis. The latter
  is, as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint, dark cylinder which
  has thirty three body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes and two
  suckers, one at each end of its body. The head sucker searches and penetrates while
  the tail sucker holds fast to the host.

  The result of the wrong type of leech being used was so vile that I shall not repeat
  it here. Dobson was lucky to survive, but he did, thank the Lord. If you decide
  to have your blood sucked by leeches, take this helpful anatomical diagram of Hirudo
  medicinalis with you. You will be able to check that your practicioner is using
  the correct type of leech, and can rest easy.



  FILMS ON TELEVISION

  In addition to the detective drama Gruesome & Turgid (see yesterday), the Hooting
  Yard television empire is pleased to announce that it has acquired the rights to
  an astounding collection of films. All of these listed below will be shown on the
  Crunlop Channel over the coming months. Our cinema critic, P. B. Totnes, will be
  reviewing as many of them as he can. As he views each film, his doubtless astute
  and piercing comments will be added, indicated by a hyperlink.

  Rusty Flasks; The Apothecary''s Safety Pin; The Subfusc Gargoyle; Hand Me That Chaffinch;
  Topiary & Miscegenation; The Gutta-Percha Pail; The Vivid Swamp (for me, Barbra
  Streisand''s finest hour); The Pitiful Teacup; To Smooch & Smooch Again; The Baleful
  Rhinoceros; Four Hundred Wooden Hens; Plankton Nightmare (I particularly liked the
  grainy, black & white opening shot of a flock of bitterns); The Crumpled Ships;
  The Queasy Hotel (spooky!!!); The Pathetic Ornithologist; The Flapping Windsock;
  Ointments of Incomprehensibility; I Wore My Hats Ineptly; Custard Gas Attack; Flailing
  Shibboleths; Journey to the Planet of Indigestion (superb!); The Wretched Spoon;
  A Placebo for Istvan; The Hideous Orchard; The Marooned Squirrel (surely the film
  of the decade); Pencil Cases in the Antarctic; Thousands upon Thousands of Wrens;
  The Pointless Torch; Corncrake! ("Melvin Gibson''s Braveheart pales in comparison",
  said Vanity Fair); The Tatterdemalion Hobbledehoy (which ought to have won a prize
  for its matchless animal-handling, what with all those stoats, weasels, bison, panthers
  & geese); The Big Magnetic Robot; The Antiseptic Xylophone; Snip Those Auburn Locks;
  I Was Puny Vercingetorix; The Chuckling Maniac (appalling--not a bit scary); The
  Cantankerous Optician; Jimmy Connors in Hell (nothing to do with the tennis player,
  apparently); Forty Years In A Bauxite Mine (my favourite foreign-language film of
  the year, despite the lack of subtitles); The Ridiculous Sponge; Rubber Beelzebub;
  Tea-strainers in Jeopardy; The Tall Nun Goes West (the finest Gerard Manley Hopkins
  adaptation I''ve ever seen); Stalin Wore A Cardigan; Ornate & Lavish Buoys (tiresome
  four-hour documentary); The Tiny Cakes; The Incredible Case of the Disparaged Chutney
  Recipe; Splendid Muck; and Weird Birds (a remake of the Van Heflin masterpiece).


  ELEVEN YEARS AGO

  Precisely eleven years ago today, on 24 January 2004, the Daily Mail reported that
  the Queen was due to have a knee operation, and that David Blunkett was accused
  of encouraging young persons to take drugs. Meanwhile, here at Hooting Yard, I posted
  a tale entitled The Phial Of Broth, or: The End Of C. W. Spraingue:

  Few people alive today remember the highly entertaining music hall act Guesbaldo
  Sopwith & His Amazing Tea Strainers. Sopwith--real name Cedric William Spraingue--was
  born in the Damp Building at Hooting Yard in 18-, and though his parents dragged
  him off a-circusing before he could even walk, he always recalled his birthplace
  with affection. At the turn of the century, when his popularity was at its height,
  Sopwith returned to Hooting Yard for the first time since infancy, to put on a Christmas
  Show for the bewildered and the fraught.

  The show was of course a tremendous success, and so thrilled were the burlap-shanked
  mayoral officers of the town that they threw an impromptu banquet for Sopwith. A
  tent was erected over the ice-rink, the rink itself covered in tough cork matting,
  and trestle-tables were carried in piled high with such delicacies as were available
  in Hooting Yard at that time.

  Sopwith was ushered to a seat at the top table, and a hush descended on the tent
  as the first course was brought in by the Hooting Yard Duckpond-Cleaner, whose name
  was Cackbag. This geriatric half-wit carried a capacious tureen containing gallons
  upon gallons of an iridescent broth, flavoured with pap, rime and bonemeal, and
  reportedly thoroughly indigestible.

  Cackbag slopped a ladleful of the broth into Sopwith''s rusty bowl, and the majestic
  entertainer was about to spoon some of the piping hot liquid into his mouth, when
  of a sudden the tent was filled with cataclasm and pandaemonium.

  "Cedric William Spraingue!" The words rang out, re-echoing round the canvas walls.
  "Tundists have come for you! We will take you now!"

  Poor Sopwith, ashen, trembling and incontinent, could do little else but to obey
  the bidding of the unseen Tundists. As bolts of purple light spurted around the
  tent, and mesmerising noises deafened the townsfolk, he crawled to the entrance
  flap, a piteous figure on his hands and knees. As soon as he was through the flap,
  the uproar ceased, the tent interior calmed, the air grew still. Clamour and rack
  were no more: but Cedric William Spraingue, alias Guesbaldo Sopwith, was gone. Like
  so many others, he had been taken by the Tundists.Who knows why, or to what end?
  Like all who fell foul of Tundism, he was ne''er seen on earth again.

  His tea strainers, amazing though they may have been, were disposed of through a
  public auction on the first anniversary of his vanishment. All his other personal
  effects were sold off, burned, cast into canals, or donated to educational institutions
  for tiny ones. All, that is, except for one item.

  The banquet was abandoned after the Tundists had fallen upon the tent. Small urchins
  were plucked from the gutters to clear everything away, and were given the uneaten
  food as a reward. One such urchin, who earlier that day had been held entranced
  by the Amazing Tea Strainers act, was so upset by the disappearance of Sopwith that
  he carried the bowl of unslurped broth away with him under his sordid tunic, as
  a trophy.

  He kept it at home in his infected hut until it began to moulder and stink out even
  this most noisome of hovels, whereupon he took it to an apothecary who very carefully
  encased what was left of the broth in a glass phial, the very phial which is today
  found underneath the water-pipes in the janitor''s cupboard next to the boiler room
  in the basement of the Museum at Hooting Yard, where it can be viewed by appointment
  only.'
