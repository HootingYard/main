  Today it is of decisive importance that I tell you about Blodgettesque farming methods.
  The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking. Consider, for
  example, the uses to which a Blodgettian farmer will put hay. There are many, many
  diagrams in the manual which show bales of hay being commandeered for all sorts
  of inventive purposes, all over the farmyard, in all six seasons of the year. That''s
  right, six seasons. One of Blodgett''s most telling innovations was his calendrical
  recalibration, if I am using the word correctly. Out go winter, spring, summer and
  autumn, or fall, as they say in Pining & Pothorst Land; in come tally, spate, the
  time of mighty remonstrations, tack, hub and bolismus. So, come hub come the haywain,
  as the saying goes, with his big fat boots stuffed with straw... I mean hay.

  We ought not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways
  of Blodgettian countryside parlance, but I cannot resist sharing with you the rhyme
  that goes Don''t forget to shut the gate / On the forty-third of spate, the meaning
  of which is obvious, as you would realise had you seen, as I have, an implacable
  army of albino hens marching off into the sunset because little Vercingetorix the
  barnyard hobbledehoy was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds to remember to close
  the gate behind him. As it happened, the fronds were poisonous, and the miscreant
  was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks, bless him.

  As with hay, so with mulch. Blodgettesque mulch is a thing of beauty, even if it
  does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett''s mulch? You would remember
  if you had, for it is to common everyday asparagus as a big shiny supersonic 26th
  century space rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes place
  mostly in bolismus, when the winds howl and thunderclaps shatter the eardrums of
  toiling farm workers, hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result of
  regular doses of Blodgett''s serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix
  to the manual.

  To begin farming the Blodgett way, all you will need is a hoe, a shapeless hat,
  iron determination, and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and ducks
  in the pond, mergansers or teal, some of them real, some of them wood-carved decoy
  ducks, and some of them just vaporous spectres of your own imagining.


  LIFE AND LOVES OF THE IMMERSION MAN

  The man with the hammers, the man with the flags. He has a second pair of shoes.
  He bought them in Blister Lane, he had them repaired. His head is the same size
  as two of anyone else''s head, or a few pounds of oranges, plums, or other fruit.
  It will take years. Once he had decided to paint his ship with stolen paint, he
  could not look back. The ship, when painted, would be burnt sienna in colour, stains
  apart. What a long ship it was, and is, and will be. It had sailed from shore to
  shore. He held sway at the helm, and on deck. He spat plum stones into his flask.
  Much later, he knew, they would be crushed, liquefied, in his blender, in his kitchen,
  in his other hut, the hut he had built at the docks, for those mornings when he
  did not set sail on his ship to reach some other shore, where he had other huts.
  In weather so suitable for breakfast on a lawn, eighteen bowls of Special K and
  a jellied, jellied eel, he would ram the oars home, force them into the muck, so
  they were perpendicular, not far away from the tallest of the six trees, which were
  poplars, or larches, or even yews. Oars fixed in place, he will paint them, the
  oars, with the delicate bristles of his Coddington brush. Its wooden handle has
  seen better days, particularly the days in Jutland, Scheveningen, Reykjavik, other
  landmarks of or near Scandinavia. Those were the days before he was pulled towards
  the seas. Who pulled him to the seas? Who made his flag? Who made his shoes? Ah,
  that I cannot say, not yet. The kettle maps were stacked in a rough wooden crate.
  The crate had been painted. Butter had been kept in this crate, butter used in the
  sandwiches he had eaten at half-time in all those polevaulting or archery competitions
  he had entered. They had struck a medal for him, he was so keen. He had lost the
  medal. It was zinc. It had fallen out of his pocket in March. Deep snow lay on the
  ground. He remembered the day well, because he had to, it was Potato Day! The village
  wrestler, the one with the goitre, had a big iron pot of gruel and slops, as he
  always did. No one knew how old he was, but his birthday parties were marked by
  rectitude and spasms. He was extremely tall, he had to stoop to enter his own house.
  It was a squalid house. It stank of vinegar. This wrestler was wont to sing remarkable
  songs as he sat on the jetty, dangling his feet in the brackish water. For many
  years he had tended his broken nose, applying a new set of bandages every day. He
  used bright red bandages, having smeared them first with ink or ointment. The bottles
  were identical, and kept on the same shelf. The shelf was made of plastic, but it
  sloped towards the left. Nothing heavier than two small bottles or some corks could
  be kept on it. He brushed his hair. The lake was hidden by trees, a mile away from
  Haemoglobin Towers. For a thousand years, the lake looked blue. One day, when he
  was famished, he swam there, he wore water-wings, rubber ones, and yellow. He had
  to inflate them with his perfumed breath. It took all morning. By noon he was exhausted.
  Later, stealthily, he crept by torchlight to the moorings. They had been varnished,
  so thoroughly that he slipped and fell. No bones were broken. But Pang Hill was
  no longer his home, nor could it ever be so, not while he wore such preposterous
  trousers. Eating jam by the spoonful, he watched the branch give way. It fell to
  the ground. He was wearing tiny sandals, three sizes too small. The stitching was
  coming loose on both of them, and not before time. The man with the clarinets had
  arrived. He sprang to his feet, on legs. They mucked about with each other''s pencil
  sharpeners all day. An ailing vulture circled overhead. It had splendid musculature,
  or thought it did. Below, on the pebbles, they donned skindiving equipment. The
  pub was shut. The landlord had rouge ears underneath his hair. He carried a selection
  of bats, pails, needles and vicuna nets. These he patted with yearning. His one
  foot was shod in an enemy''s shoe. A token of combat. It had a vulgar reek, but
  squashed ants and earwigs on the paving slabs with the best of them. This was called
  HACK-SLOT B. It meant so much, or it meant nothing, he was not sure. Long ago he
  had become entangled in the waterlogged corridors of the Big Damp Building, and
  now there was no escape. The magnificence of it was breathtaking. It had taken centuries
  to build, but only last year was the tin bath warehouse added on. He spat in it,
  and kept on spitting, he was unable to stop himself. Feathers sprouted, but did
  not grow. They were spindly and vicious. He could no longer remember how to speak
  Hungarian, if he ever knew. His boxer shorts were blue, from Budapest. There is
  a reason for everything, but not for food. Food must be speared with big tin forks.
  Or so he thought. He poked at the plankton with his fork. The plate had been smashed,
  it was in bits on the linoleum. He intended to take up athletics. They would wrap
  him in flowers and other greenery, and all because he had ruined his crayons when
  he was a tot. He was wicked, wicked, and he went on a cruise. The cruise took him
  north. Then it took him west. He was not sure which coinage to use. He had some
  change in his little pockets. It weighed so much, he had to trudge. After careful
  planning, he set fire to all the maps. He put the cartons to one side. They would
  be useful to him later on, if at all. But it was time to hold a grudge. He lighted
  upon a fishmonger, and rapped him on the nose with a fountain pen. Maroon ink spurted
  out on to the fishmonger''s mouth and chin. He had lockjaw and some pianos. Where
  did he keep his pianos? They sent a detective to find out. One day, he would brandish
  despicable wooden things inside his tent. It was a famous tent, but age had frayed
  it. It was decorated with a boa constrictor motif, lacquered in mauve. He came upon
  it on a mountain top, he hurled it into a sand pit. His skull was perfectly formed
  and bright blue. There had been much talk of this in thousands of corridors and
  on horseback. All the fruit had been chewed. He checked his dictionary for errors.
  Under B he found plenty. He pasted them up, threw back his head, extricated some
  tacks from the hardboard, and shoved them into an envelope. This was stylish. He
  sat by the big clock. His sister arrived. She was an emigree. She buried three or
  four pelicans or yaks near a factory. That had to be the factory. This must be an
  ambulance! Its bleepers are off-pitch and ungodly. Bundled inside a blanket, she
  sported a mask, half of it carved out of mahogany and the rest out of something
  metallic. Delicate traceries of bip lay smeared on the gasworks, for this was Raymond''s
  village. His dubbin was better than the rest. He had come this far, and had no sandwiches
  left. He was in agony. Darning the beekeeping outfit had been no laughing matter.
  The reek of sandalwood and lavender was in the air. He was penniless. Wearing an
  altimeter instead of a wristwatch, he careered along the towpath of the canal. The
  Immersion Man was on his way.


  DOBSONIANA

  News has reached us that Dobson, that indefatigable and infamous pamphleteer, is
  at work on his autobiography. Telephone calls, faxes and emails requesting further
  details went unanswered, so we sent the Tatterdemalion Hobbledehoy to ransack Dobson''s
  shed under the cover of a pitch black night when no stars were visible a-twinkling
  in the firmament. He managed to retrieve these four perplexing excerpts:

  My mother''s brooch was blue. She took me to the lake and punched my jaw. She threw
  my breakfast into a pond. I banged my head against a barge the day she showed me
  the canal.

  There were massive shutters in that room, and I had never left it. Ah, I had brilliantine
  in my hair. There were roses, there were lockets, I was lacking something, so unnerved--but
  for my hatred she''d''ve seen it, even eaten it, got it on her eyelash, crushed
  it, broken it, eked it out of someone''s purse or loved it, lusted after it. So
  here''s my signifier--you can read it, you can keep it. You''re so fucking thick
  you don''t even know what to do with it. Well ... eyebrows, hair, my pastels, then
  breakfast and a lover. Oh come on, you must be guessing. Or maybe you''re just so
  fetching. I''m done with fleshing out my lying. My hair is in a tangle and I haven''t
  paid the rent. But I had brilliantine in my hair, and yours were better shutters.
  Damn it, I couldn''t even see your rubbish, but I had brilliantine in my hair.

  When I stood at the edge of the lake, when I stood on the bridge, when I looked
  at the water, when I saw the broken fountain, when I broke my neck, when I lay awake
  all night, when I couldn''t see a thing, when my mind began to snap, when I was
  spoon-fed cocoa, when what I said went askew, when they proffered me jam, when my
  tongue was hanging out, when I loitered in Ulm, when the diving-board cracked beneath
  me, when I fell into a pond, when I was all washed up, when I ate too much chocolate,
  when nothing broke my spirit, when I hosted a TV chat-show, when I went to a wedding,
  when I broke down in tears, when I was in despair, when bracken snagged my socks,
  when illness cast a shadow, when death appeared lascivious, when sadness crushed
  my feelings, when I was struck by lightning, when all I did was worry, when I threw
  in the towel, when I was scorched in deserts, when no one gave me biscuits, when
  all I had was breathing, when my gas bill sent me bonkers, when you told me that
  I''d had it, all I wanted was [illegible]

  When the tiny Mexican house on stilts was revealed, behind such rich brocade curtains,
  and we fell in love, Captain Snap''s wooden leg was rammed between us. He was a
  brutish man, vengeful, hirsute and lewd, prone to piss in vinegar jars and to take
  our clocks to bits. I remember how he left the parts--dial, hands, cogs and springs--littered
  about our flat, smeared with marmalade, peppered with talc, and reeking of his dubbin.
  We walked on either side of him, mouthing words of ire and loathing, as he limped--stump-clunk,
  stump-clunk, stump-clunk--by the wharf, jabbering and shouting. Oh, he never made
  any sense. Captain Snap''s wooden leg was rammed between us. I took a hunting rifle
  and shot him through the head.Then we were together, darling, and he was good and
  dead.


  PETROCHEMICAL SHIVER-ME-TIMBERS CONCLAVE

  Rookie pirates aboard container ships need to watch their backs. As a seaside doctor,
  I cannot count the number of cases I''ve had of youngsters fresh from their first
  sea voyage coming to me with cutlass wounds or, worse, lead pellets from a blunderbuss
  embedded in their crania, dangerously close to the brain.

  One such lad was Rufus Farjeon, who ran away to sea when he was just seven. He ran
  from his parents'' gingerbread cottage all the way to the beach, panting, panting,
  and he swam out to a container ship moored on the horizon and clambered aboard,
  and in his tiny squeak of a voice he said to the captain "Rufus Farjeon, aged nine,
  reporting for duty, cap''n!"

  Captain Cack was not taken in by the boy''s lying about his age, but he placed an
  avuncular hand on Farjeon''s shoulder and quizzed him on his knowledge of obscure
  marine imponderabilities. The captain''s right hand was the avuncular one. His left
  hand was withered.

  Over the next few weeks, young Farjeon scrubbed the decks, sloshed out nautical
  buckets, polished the railings to a gleam, and learned all there was to know about
  bells at sea. He also sat at Captain Cack''s breakfast table, reading aloud to the
  old sea dog from Yoko Ono''s book Grapefruit, while the captain ate plentiful toast,
  hard tack biscuits and, by coincidence, halves of grapefruit.

  Then, one Thursday some weeks into the voyage, the blond and brilliantined bo''sun
  took the boy aside as he trundled a clattering barrel through a narrow passage between
  containers.

  "A word of warning," muttered the bo''sun, in tones of menace, "At eight bells the
  captain is holding a petrochemical shiver-me-timbers conclave in his cabin. There
  may be trouble. Watch your back."

  But Rufus Farjeon, who had celebrated his eighth birthday a week ago, was by now
  puffed up, preening and reckless, and he ignored the bo''sun''s words. Reeking of
  grog and blinded by the pitiless tropical sun, he behaved at the conclave in a foolhardy
  manner, so angering a bloodthirsty corsair that he was taken to the poop deck and
  shot in the head.

  And thus he turned up in my seaside surgery a few days later. I bandaged his wounds
  and prescribed a course of Doctor Wainwright''s Brain Pills. I well knew that just
  one pill was enough to stun an ostrich, and I had the lad on twenty of them a day,
  for his metabolism was inhuman. I needed to find out if he was a changeling. He
  was. And now he sits like a little potentate on a throne on the jetty, facing out
  to sea, his bandages discarded and his eyes aglow, and mermaids come to gawp at
  him, and minnows swim in ribbons at his feet, for he is Triton now, and will always
  be, throned, festooned with seaweed, and staring out to sea.


  AT HOME WITH TANQUOD SHUDDERY

  I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought some
  custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and
  a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and
  the Pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a
  flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras. I went to the shops and bought
  some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras
  and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap
  and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds.
  I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin
  of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and
  grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
  and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and
  twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin and then I went home and took each
  item out of its paper bag, and put the paper bags on the fire, and smoke billowed
  up the chimney, and I saw that it was good, and I declared that it was good, in
  a loud voice, so loud that my neighbours came a-running, they tumbled into my room
  in their stockinged feet, and I stood there like a Jack o''Lantern, with my custard
  and brooch and flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and my jam tart and
  four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin, and I said to my neighbours
  "Behold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighbourly folk, behold and wonder,"
  and they did, and I made a pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their
  cups from the pot, and my shopping I distributed to my neighbours as gifts, and
  their hearts grew warm, and that is what happened when I had what is called an "At
  Home", in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the farm, where cows graze and hens
  cluck, and the farmer has gone to seed.


  A GUIDE TO POINTY TOWN : PART ONE

  Pointy Town lies just south of the Port of Tongs, and is famous for its amusing
  biscuits & cakes, dustbin exhibitions, ferocious geese, horrible icing-sugar jewellery,
  kaleidoscopic lettuce museum (never open), public quacking recitals, squalor, tortoises,
  utopian vinegar works, & xanthous (yellow) zanies. The few squares that existed
  in Pointy Town before the revolution were used as ostrich colonies and horse laundries
  rather than, as they are today, places of lasciviousness and grotesquerie. The Triumph
  of Marmalade Square, in particular, fenced round with a rude wooden railing, interrupted
  by lumpish brick piers at intervals of every half-dozen yards, partakes more of
  the character of a pond than a parterre; and as for Kevin Costner Square, it has
  very much the air of a sorry cow-yard, where blackguards are to be seen assembled
  daily, playing at husselcap up to their ankles in mire.'
