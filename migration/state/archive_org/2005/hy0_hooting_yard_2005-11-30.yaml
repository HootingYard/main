  originally issued as a special edition of Crunlop! : A Splendid Periodical in 2003


  Lothar Preen

  Just 99 pages long, Lothar Preen''s first novel is slim, even throwaway, and was
  completely ignored by both reviewers and the reading public. It is a particularly
  hackneyed example of the "looking-for-cormorants" genre. The hero, Paler Hornet
  (an obvious anagram of the author), is a young explorer charged by his father with
  going in search of cormorants. In a series of supposed journal entries, Hornet describes
  his failure in prose that is listless, turgid, and littered with innumerable misuses
  of the prepositions by and with. Although he was characteristically contemptuous
  of his detractors, it is no surprise that Lothar Preen waited nearly two decades
  to publish again. But when he did, what a revelation!

  Unleashed upon the world at the height of les evenements of May 1968, Preen''s second
  novel casts a glowering eye upon bourgeois society. By turns caustic, pitiless &
  scathing--and superbly comic--Preen lashes out at sacred cows and shibboleths in
  a manner described by one critic at the time as "like something written by the idiot
  bastard offspring of Ford Madox Ford and Veronica Lake during the final gasps of
  Stalinism". At 1,844 pages, it is one of the longest novels of the 20th century.
  Cunningly--and Preen can be the most artful of writers--this matchless stream of
  invective is disguised as a series of letters home from a peripatetic ornithologist
  engaged in a study of the nesting habits of the curlew. Preen uses the narrator''s
  witlessness, myopia, and inability to tell one bird from another as a metaphor for
  a society in chains. An abridged version for children, with four lovely colour plates
  by Preen''s acolyte Marigold Chew, was issued in 1983.

  As if to confound those who saw him as a radical, Lothar Preen''s next book was
  a delicate, miniaturist evocation of domesticity set in an idyllic barnyard. Full
  of countryside wisdom and bosky charm, it was condemned as trash, and rightly so.

  Loathsome! Ach, loathsome is the man whose flesh is the colour of spinach, whose
  hat stinks, who sharpens pencils by daylight and whose nights are beset by dreams
  of eerie albino hens The opening lines of Preen''s fourth novel have been quoted
  so widely & so often that it comes as a shock to learn that they are absent from
  all but the very final draft of this majestic tour de force which won the Groot,
  Pang, Fledgling, Gobbo & Musty Spillage awards, to name only a few, for if I were
  to list all the honours lavished on this mighty tome we would be here all day and
  even you, gentle reader, even you would begin to yawn and scratch your head, from
  which no doubt beetles would fall.

  Wherein lies the peculiar genius of Befuddled By Linnets? At first glance it is
  a simple tale--indeed, the Korean critic Park No Lip dismissed it as "cretinous",
  although he later wrote a lengthy retraction before swallowing poison in the laundry
  room of a shabby hotel. (His widow was imprisoned & his children languished in an
  orphanage--a point to ponder for those who dared to cross Lothar Preen!)

  The novel, divided into no less than four thousand short chapters, arranged alphabetically
  by opening lines, follows the progress of a would-be scientist named Pearl E. Thorn
  as she trudges through various patches of woodland listening out for the characteristic
  "chi chi chi chi" song of the linnet. But Thorn is no ornithologist--she is an oceanographer
  with a sideline in amateur map-making--and she is also hard of hearing. According
  to notes rescued from the charred shell of Preen''s so-called "Potato Building",
  where he lived and worked for nearly thirty years before it burned down in 1989,
  the character was originally intended to be profoundly deaf (and, by the by, one-legged).
  Once again, Preen appears to have made an incredible number of changes to the final
  draft, restoring not only some hearing to his heroine--in her right ear: the left
  remains useless--but completely rewriting the long central section in which what
  appears to be a flock of cassowaries is yoked irreversibly to the heroine''s dismal
  fate. It is a moot point whether flock is the correct noun of assemblage for the
  cassowary, but research must come to a stop somewhere and I have now got a headache,
  as you can imagine. You would too if you were to read all of Lothar Preen''s books
  at one sitting. Be that as it may, there is an unbearable poignancy in Pearl E.
  Thorn''s growing realisation that she is unable to distinguish between the exquisite
  song of the linnet and the raucousness of crows, corncrakes, and all those other
  birds that make such a gruesome racket.

  Preen''s adoption of a female narrative voice was much praised for its authenticity,
  although I have to say that, for me, it is woefully unconvincing. I side with the
  anonymous reviewer who disparaged the author''s attempt to "join the Brothers Johnson
  in the Land of Ladies", an amusing reference to the American funk duo who had a
  measure of popularity in the 1970s. Preen, of course, despised funk, as evidenced
  by his ferocious essay Thunderous Execrations Of Things Both Abominable & Ripe For
  Obliteration Which I Would Willingly Tear To Smithereens With My Bare Hands, Cackling
  With Obscene Glee As I Did So (1977).

  Dismissed as worthless when published thirty years to the day after Preen''s fictional
  debut, time has been kind to his fifth novel. Written in the form of an instructional
  manual for children, it has all the charm of a catechism mixed with the faintly
  sordid air of belle epoque pornography. It is also Preen''s only foray into science
  fiction, an unexpected departure to be sure, given that he clearly had no sympathy
  for, nor understanding of, the genre. Yet somehow the writing has a mischievousness
  which has made it Preen''s most popular book. The moorhens of the title, incidentally,
  only look like moorhens, or at least what Preen fondly imagined moorhens to look
  like. They are in fact a race of super-ignorant beings from a dying planet in a
  distant galaxy. The author quotes freely from both Epictetus and Gerard Manley Hopkins,
  though not to any apparent purpose. Nevertheless, an entertaining enough romp and
  perfect holiday reading.

  Frankly indigestible, this monstrous work--at 1,748 pages only a little shorter
  than Bamboozled by Curlews--has divided its critics since that strange day at the
  end of March 1981 when it hit the bookshops just as the news was announced of the
  death of De Witt Wallace, founder of the Reader''s Digest. Much blood has been spilled
  over the placing of that apostrophe, not least Lothar Preen''s. Throughout his life,
  the novelist was a fanatical devotee of the magazine, regularly penning articles
  such as I Am John''s Cardigan and It Pays To Incite Your Witch Doctor, none of which
  was ever published. Legend has it that there exists somewhere an archive of Wallace''s
  letters to his indomitable--if unsolicited--contributor, from the early, polite
  rejections to the last, desperate pleas, insults and threats. Preen ignored all
  of them, firing off ill-written drivel to the magazine virtually every month for
  decades. We are perhaps fortunate that he kept copies of only a fraction of his
  output, and that the Reader''s Digest consigned every last scrap of it to the bonfire.When
  he heard of Wallace''s death, Preen locked himself in the Potato Building for a
  period of mourning, and refused to appear in public to promote his new novel, about
  which I shall say only this: there is a mildly amusing paragraph on page 16, a choice
  use of synecdoche on page 833, a superb neologism at the end of chapter 53, and
  a misprint in the very last line.

  Having turned his hand to science fiction, Preen unwisely decided to have a bash
  at a crime novel. Surmising that all fictional detectives must have trademark idiosyncracies
  or foibles, he made his Captain "Ern" Plethora a retired Jesuit whaling ship''s
  chaplain with a club foot and a tattoo of a star on his forehead, whose hobbies
  include pole-vaulting, testing for pH values, & repairing churns. In fact, so many
  pages are spent trying to elicit the reader''s interest in this preposterous figure
  that Preen quite forgets about his plot, which begins in incoherence and peters
  out into what I have elsewhere dubbed "grandiloquent stupidity". I repeat this remark
  despite the fact that when it first appeared in print one of Preen''s trained brutes
  abducted me and nearly drowned me in an ornamental pond somewhere near Blister Lane
  Gasworks.

  By the late 1980s, as Lothar Preen the musician became ever more lauded--this was,
  lest we forget, the decade of the Sonatina & Variations: Homage a Ricardo Montalban--Preen
  the novelist was considered largely a spent force. Not one of his books was still
  in print, and no publisher of repute would touch him. Indeed, it was only through
  his criminal connections in the taverns of Marseilles that Dumbstruck by Bitterns
  ever saw the light of day. The Eternal Palace of Literature must forever be grateful
  to the grimy, hirsute matelot whose nefarious intrigues led to the meeting of Lothar
  Preen and F X Duggleby. It was Duggleby--deranged, revolting and crapulous, but
  also erudite, wealthy and given to wearing particularly decisive cravats--who became
  Preen''s champion, setting up his Editions de Duggleby imprint to issue the by now
  monocular author''s work. The first fruit of the partnership was this awe-inspiring
  roman a clef in which Preen creates an alternative history of 19th century Greenland.
  Those new to Preen are invariably astonished at the facility--the lightness!--with
  which a straightforward story about a team of bird-spotters on a futile expedition
  to find bitterns above the Arctic Circle is transformed into a multi-layered prose-fantasia
  of matchless genius. Vivid and towering, it remains Preen''s greatest achievement,
  and it is somehow fitting that all royalties he earned from it were used to fund
  a string of gambling dens in iniquitous ports and grubby harbours.

  "To sail the sea is an occupation at once repulsive and attractive" wrote Hilaire
  Belloc. It is a sentiment with which Lothar Preen concurred. The maritime world
  was one which informed so much of his music, yet his fiction remained stubbornly
  land-locked--until the sudden, late glory of his ninth novel. Its conception we
  owe to Duggleby. The drink-crazed billionaire lured Preen on to his crumbling wooden
  yacht and headed for the middle of one of the oceans, I am not sure which one, refusing
  to let the ageing author ashore until he had written a "tale of the sea". For the
  first three weeks, Preen cursed and sulked by turns, until he collapsed with a fever
  brought on by proximity to bilgewater. Once recovered, he set to his task, sitting
  at a worm-eaten escritoire on the orlop deck, lashed by tropical storms or possibly
  icy gales, depending upon the geography. The result was this brief 102-page spine-tingler
  in which guillemots confound the spluttering, pneumonia-racked narrator.

  Lothar Preen''s final work of fiction is unreadable. Self-consciously "experimental",
  it was written in the space of five hours on the upper deck of a bus plying the
  route between some god-forsaken village full of priests and imbeciles and the hot
  air balloon launch station at Mustard Parva. By now a cantankerous and bitter old
  man, Preen was estranged from Duggleby and his tough sailor pals. Even the loyal
  Marigold Chew (1955-1998) was fed up to the back teeth with him. In a previously
  unpublished letter written from her deathbed, Chew wrote:

  "By then [i.e. the Year of Our Lord MCMXCVI] he was having constant pangs. His brow
  had become ignoble and his hair was often rife with breadcrumbs. He lacked dash.
  I would place pots of soup in front of his Cyclopean visage, only to discover him
  hours later wandering aimlessly around shops that sold or rented camping equipment.
  His blotchy flesh was blotchier still. He used to creak when he brushed those once-glistening
  teeth. I had thought them superb, long ago, those Preen-fangs. Must our gods be
  so frail? I suppose they must. And yet part of me wishes still to bless his cotton
  socks."

  On St Mungo''s Day 1997, on a glamorous morning bright with spangled sunbeams, Lothar
  Preen died. Like a dog.


  SOME PONDS, A HOTEL, THE HOLLYHOCKS

  I--Some Ponds. There are seven ponds. Their names are Brink, Cramped, Dribble, Lamont,
  Presumption, Ravenous and Unholy. In a lead box at the bottom of one of the ponds
  an Icelandic fontoon lies sealed against the elements. But which pond? The fontoon
  is made of some nameless metallic alloy, and it has a long history. Countless learned
  tomes have been devoted to pondering its existence, location, significance, colour,
  smell, incontrovertibility and malevolence. Its value is incalculable. A facsimile
  made of petrified dough was sold by the Museum at Ack-on-the-Vug for an undisclosed
  sum. The identity of the buyer was also undisclosed, at the time. Now, this shadowy
  figure has the true fontoon almost in his clutches. He has booked in to a hotel
  just four hundred yards away from the ponds.

  II--A Hotel. The major domo at the hotel stared out of the dining-room window. The
  sky was overcast. Soon the drizzle would begin. It always did. He hooted, once and
  once only. He was afraid of sheep, baffled by corkage, continually muttering about
  the gasworks, defiant, elegantly ragged, flappable during snowstorms, grotesquely
  carnivorous, helpless with starch, ignoble, just dying to shake hands with a lion
  tamer, kept waiting for hours by guests late for breakfast, lascivious yet hard
  of hearing, mistakenly shot at by poachers, nerve-wracked, overcoated, pitiful,
  quite likely to hoot for a second time, risibly bemuffled, still awaiting a voyage
  around the world, tempestuous every Thursday, unbelievably festooned with old sacking
  and netting, vigilant, weak, xerophilous despite the rain, young at heart and zestful
  at the prospect of his daily milk supplement. He hooted for a second time, much
  louder.

  The hotel was fully occupied. Among the guests were anthropomorphic beings, bauxite
  miners, cartographers, dribbling thugs, elk fanciers, fontoon hunters, genuflecting
  dolts, heroic chefs, idiots savants, jugglers, kaolin quarry workers, lopsided people,
  marionettes, nautical curmudgeons, old besmirched gravediggers, pond draggers, quicklime
  spreaders, ruffians, sink bashers, taloned maniacs, untidy throwbacks, vinegar brewers,
  waxen image igniters, xylophone construction experts, yellow-bellied burblers and
  zinc inspectors. Watching them all gobbling down their breakfast porridge, the major
  domo tried to work out who was who. There appeared to be some trouble at one of
  the tables in the far corner. An aged couple, raddled and with frenzied gleams in
  their eyes, were raising their voices at a pallid and neurasthenic git still wearing
  his nightshirt. This man was Richard Widdmarke, implacable seeker of the Icelandic
  fontoon. His antagonists were a cartographer and a lopsided person. Their names
  were, respectively, Eileen and Wolfgang Hollyhock.

  III--The Hollyhocks. Widdmarke did not realise that for over forty years the Hollyhocks
  had also been searching desperately for the Icelandic fontoon. Their interest had
  been ignited by Eileen''s discovery of a tiny zinc fontoon in the Serengeti. It
  appeared to have talismanic properties, which Wolfgang had catalogued into seven
  basic groupings: elemental, dishevelled, yellow, crimped, congruent, dismal and
  vagabond. Among their luggage, the Hollyhocks carried the fruits of years of research.
  Eight hundred ledgers and a voluminous card index system contained information on
  all manner of fontoons, voils, Wesniod slabs, forensic triumphs and choir-stall
  scrapings. A parallel compendium of exciting facts about flags, pennants and bunting
  had fallen over the edge of their raft some years ago, or perhaps been lost in a
  swamp.

  After the altercation at the breakfast table, the Hollyhocks realised that Richard
  Widdmarke was, like them, on the verge of discovering the sunken lead box containing
  the Icelandic fontoon. They immediately set out in the drizzle to drag the ponds.
  They wore horrifying mackintoshes. When they reached Lamont, the nearest of the
  ponds, they were outraged to find Widdmarke already there, equipped with a thrilling
  collection of nets, poles, metal detectors, rotating things, crimping irons, and
  booster guns...

  The major domo stood at the dining-room window, peering out through the drizzle
  towards the seven ponds. A fight had broken out among three of the guests. Mackintoshes
  had been removed and boxing gloves donned. There were fisticuffs. There were gunshots.
  There was wailing. Before long, all three had managed to drown one another, and
  all in the same pond. But which pond? And was it the same pond at the bottom of
  which a lead box lay?

  The major domo turned away, hooting quietly. He trudged into the kitchen and made
  a start on the porridge-encrusted bowls. He had work to do.


  THE TALE OF GASPARD

  Gaspard worked for the Gas Board. In appearance, he resembled the man dressed in
  red raising his left arm in Hieronymus Bosch''s painting The Ship of Fools. (Incidentally,
  while we are--briefly--on the subject of art, you may or may not know that the famous
  foot from the credit sequence of Monty Python''s Flying Circus was taken from Angelo
  Bronzino''s Allegory : Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time.) Gaspard was both dutiful and
  dismaying. An air of glumness hovered o''er him; to some, it was a visible aura.
  Flies and other tiny annoying things with wings seemed to follow him around. Had
  he the wit, Gaspard could have made himself useful to the world''s entomologists,
  but he was diffident as well as being dutiful and dismaying. His Gas Board desk
  was a sorry piece of office furniture, rickety and fragile. Gaspard sat at it for
  many, many hours each day, to no apparent purpose. There is a story by John Cheever
  which ends with the question: "Oh, what can you do with a man like that?" The same
  can be asked of Gaspard, for there is something almost inhuman in his dullness.
  Let us whisk him away, then, and place him in the icy wastes of Northern Canada,
  sitting on a felled log, surrounded by frisky reindeer, sipping from his flask of
  piping hot broth, as stars sparkle in the clear night sky. A voice booms from the
  heavens: "Gaspard! Gaspard!" He is stricken with terror, yet he knows this is the
  most important thing that has ever happened to him, so he reaches into the pocket
  of his anorak and takes out a little notepad and a biro. Irritatingly, just as he
  is about to jot down whatever supernatural commands he is to be given, the voice
  falls silent, and the only sound is that of a pitiless Arctic gale roaring in his
  ears. We shall leave him there, as he drinks the last of his broth, and though he
  remains ignorant of his destiny, we can rest assured that Gaspard is soon to become
  the Stipendiary Vizier of Cack and know aught but wassail and glee for all eternity,
  for he is immortal, and he is magnificent.'
