full_text: 'IN LOOPY COPSE

  In Loopy Copse, when I was young, all golden were the shrubs and trees. All golden
  I remember them, and Bonkers Maisie from the farm. Maisie was unkempt and mad, just
  like her brother and her dad. Her sister left them long ago. She went to join a
  music hall. She made it as a chorus girl and then she graced the silent screen.
  She looked like Edna Purviance and had a hat named after her. But Bonkers Maisie
  never did, for she was always dressed in rags.

  The golden trees of Loopy Copse in those blue summers long ago, oh I remember them
  with woe as I sit here twirling my moustache. My woe is such that I may sob and
  mop my tears with my jacket cuff. But both my cuffs are smeared with grease, I dipped
  them in the soup tureen. I don''t know why, I don''t know when, I don''t know who
  knocks at my door. This bombed hotel has stale air. The other guests are rakes and
  fops. I''m sitting in my rocking chair recalling the gold of Loopy Copse.


  WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE CARPENTERS

  Karen played the drums and sang. Her brother Richard played keyboards and supplied
  backing vocals. Unfortunately, Karen died young. Richard is still alive, still active
  in music, but The Carpenters as a duo are no longer with us.

  These bare facts stated, astute readers will note the remarkable similarities between
  The Carpenters and the homonymic The Carpenters who were so successful during the
  1970s with songs such as Close To You and Calling Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft.
  Neither of these songs was recorded by The Carpenters of whom we speak, for their
  music was somewhat different, an outre blend of salsa, bluegrass, acid jazz, bell-ringing
  and caterwauling, often driven by motorised electric balalaikas programmed by Karen.
  Richard was known to be fond of factory hooters.

  Their debut album, The Carpenters Play The Music Of James Last From An Abandoned
  Salt Mine, included the astonishing sixteen-minute Dying Bee Music # 8, which featured
  guests including Blodgett, Blodgett''s dentist, Blodgett''s dentist''s dentist,
  and a young, impressionable Scottish lad called Midge Ure. Sales were few, and a
  booking on a transatlantic cruise liner proved ill-advised. Neither Karen nor Richard
  could swim, and when the ship sank off the Auckland Islands they spent six weeks
  marooned in a dinghy, fighting. Some say Karen''s health problems stemmed from this
  ordeal, and they well be right, but in the words of the old farmyard saying, "Never
  put two carpenters in the same dinghy".

  Their annus mirabilis was probably 1975. In a nine-month period, they released no
  less than twenty-six EPs, each of which was conceived as a "punitive retrenchment",
  to use Richard''s phrase. Karen scoffed at this description, incidentally, preferring
  to think of these matchless works as "lullabyes for locust swarms". The most startling
  thing about the records is the pared-down instrumentation--Karen thumping the sole
  of her boot on a giant drum, Richard tentatively prodding the black keys on a plastic
  toy piano. Both sang, of course, or rather hummed, gargled and choked.

  After Karen toppled from a radio mast in 1981, Richard approved the release of just
  one further recording, a set of minuets, bagatelles, and oompahs arranged for brass
  band and an electronically-enhanced flock of chaffinches. Karen''s drumming had
  been recorded pneumatically in the clinic where she spent her final years, sitting
  slumped on a catbird seat wrapped in a gaudy and enormous poncho which engulfed
  her tiny, wasted body.

  We attempted to interview Richard for this short article, but his people sent an
  email saying that he was far too peevish.


  PLAGUE-INFECTED SQUIRREL OF DOOM

  News comes in that the entire western half of the United States has been shut down
  due to the presence in Los Angeles of a plague-infected squirrel. Something along
  those lines, anyway. While I do a spot of fact-checking to ensure I haven''t exaggerated
  the threat, it seems apposite to repost this piece from nine long years ago.

  Dobson was afraid of squirrels. Here''s why. It was a damp and ruinous Thursday
  and he had not had any breakfast. He slapped his hand on the table and shouted "I
  must have marmalade! I must have some marmalade!" There was nobody to hear his complaint
  except for an ant which was making its way across the floor of his hovel, and the
  ant didn''t care, being an insect. Dobson had not even noticed the ant, in any case.
  He leapt out of his chair, put on his big reindeer-hide anorak brought back from
  one of his Arctic expeditions, and trudged outside, muttering now instead of shouting.

  Have I ever told you there were several important trees on the path outside Dobson''s
  door? There was a sycamore and a yew, a larch and a pine. Dobson was fond of trees,
  usually, although he was unable to tell the difference between them. Gone were the
  days when he would festoon his hair with fallen leaves and twigs, inviting ridicule
  from the local whippersnappers. Dobson in the days of which I write had adopted
  a sober mien, indeed a gloomy one.

  "Dobson, Dobson, don''t look so dismayed," his acquaintances would say, to which
  the out of print pamphleteer''s response was to look heavenward, as if in great
  pain, adopting the air of an early Christian martyr, one lined up for some particularly
  bloodthirsty persecution. Dobson often skimmed through the pages of Foxe''s Book
  of Martyrs to pick up tips. But I digress.

  On this damp marmaladeless morning, Dobson walked past the sycamore, the yew, the
  larch and the pine, onward past a repulsive ditch, past the post office and the
  pig huts and the vipers'' nest and the glue factory, up the lane towards the Big
  Unexplained Building On The Hill. The wind howled. It always did. Back in the hovel,
  the ant had vanished into a crevice in the wainscot, just as Dobson arrived at the
  gates of the Building. These gates were enormous and forbidding and strange and
  rusty and locked and bolted and unnecessary, for there was a wooden door set in
  the base and brickish wall which skirted the building, and it was only a few feet
  away to the left of the gates, or to the right, I cannot remember precisely, I have
  never been there myself, I am only reporting this as it was told to me by Marigold
  Chew on the day after Dobson''s death, after she had had her bath, and was sipping
  tea from an inelegant tin mug in the shabby parlour of a horrible hotel hard by
  the banks of the River Wretched in Sibodnedwabshire.

  Dobson knew all about the wooden door, so why did he tarry by the strange rusty
  gates? Was he confused, was his mind a jumble due to lack of marmalade? Or did he
  have a tryst? We do not know. We do know that Dobson stood at those gates on that
  damp Thursday, peering intently through them, for a full quarter of an hour before
  turning around and heading off to Old Jack Blothead''s Foodstuffs Tent, where he
  bought a jar of marmalade and some pastry and a pot of some kind of edible paste
  which Old Jack Blothead had left unlabelled. The year was 1952. Dobson and the vendor
  of foodstuffs had their usual argument about the pamphleteer''s promissory note,
  a page torn from his notebook on which he had scrawled words to the effect that
  sooner or later he would do right by Old Jack Blothead, and if he did not then may
  the heavens smite him and may all his days be leavened with woe. It was advantageous
  for Dobson that Blothead was a man of great charity and puny intellect, and after
  a few minutes he left the tent through its great grimy flaps, armed with his jar
  and pot and a paper bag for the pastry. They would not fit in the single pocket
  of his anorak, so he carried them in his ungloved, unmittened hands.

  What pangs led Dobson back to the strange enormous rusty gates of the Big Unexplained
  Building On The Hill? There was a fallen log, a log fallen from a trembling poplar,
  slap bang next to the gates, and Dobson sat on it and ate the pastry, and he stayed
  sitting there despite the fact that it began to rain heavily. He didn''t even bother
  to pull up the hood of his anorak, although that may be because it was rife with
  holes made by starving moths and his head would have got wet anyway. Wet, but surely
  not as wet as it did get, as he sat on the poplar log in the downpour eating pastry
  with his pot of paste and marmalade jar beside him outside the forbidding and strange
  and rusty and locked and bolted gates of the Big Unexplained Building On The Hill
  on that Thursday morning in 1952 when he first became terrified of squirrels.

  "Why," I asked Marigold Chew as she sipped her tea in the shabby hotel parlour,
  "Why did Dobson become so fearful of squirrels on that particular day?" She glanced
  at me briefly, and I was disconcerted by the weird look in her eyes. "Those bushy
  tails..." she began, then fell silent, turning to stare out of the window. I followed
  her gaze, and saw the gravedigger walking across the lawn, toting his spade jauntily
  over his shoulder. "Those bushy, bushy tails..." Marigold Chew repeated. She drank
  the rest of her tea, put the mug down on the floor by her feet, and stood up. "I
  must go and have a few words with the gravedigger," she said, and swept out of the
  room as breezily as a bereaved woman on crutches can sweep breezily from a hotel
  parlour on the day after the death of her one true friend on this magnificent and
  baffling planet.


  PRACTICAL SEAGULL EXERCISES

  If you have a pet seagull, it is extremely important to ensure that it gets the
  requisite amount of exercise. Have you got any idea how dangerous it is for a seagull
  to become idle and listless? Many seabird doctors have, over the years, been driven
  to despair by the negligence of certain people who keep seagulls as pets. One such
  medic, whose name, by weird coincidence, is a perfect anagram of auk tern guillemot
  gull, has written a memoir in which he lambasts some of the feckless seaside-resort
  inhabitants whose gulls he came to tend. His language is at times violent, but what
  shines through the prose is a great love for seabirds and an almost pathological
  loathing of human beings.

  In an appendix, the doctor recommends certain exercises which the responsible gull-keeper
  ought to encourage a bird to perform as part of its fitness regime. Mindful of the
  depressed economies of most coastal regions, all of the exercises are designed to
  cost little in the way of kit. For example, gull exercise number ten, reprinted
  below, involves nothing more than access to a limitless supply of corrugated cardboard:

  Gull Exercise Number Ten

  Fetch a few large sheets of corrugated cardboard and take them to your seagull.
  Announce in a loud voice that you will reward the bird with a bucket of fish-heads
  and entrails if it tears the corrugated cardboard to pieces with its fearsome beak.
  Stand well back. Most well-balanced seagulls will shred the corrugated cardboard
  in a matter of minutes. Note: if you do not actually have a bucket full of fish-heads
  and entrails with which to reward the gull at the end of its exercise, it may become
  angered and vengeful, so make sure you are wearing protective clothing and have
  removed all traces of fish-odour from yourself by bathing in lemon juice, or alternatively
  keeping as far away from the harbour as you can, especially at those times when
  the fishing boats come in to port with their catch of sprats and gudgeon.'
