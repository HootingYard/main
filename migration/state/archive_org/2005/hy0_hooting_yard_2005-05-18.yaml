full_text: 'THE BOOK OF GNATS

  By request, or possibly cajoling, from a few readers, here is the complete text
  of The Book Of Gnats, first published in Massacre 4 : An Annual Anthology Of Anti-Naturalistic
  Writings (Indelible Inc, 1993), edited by the esteemed Roberta Mock. I have taken
  the opportunity to mop up a handful of infelicities in the text, but otherwise it''s
  pretty much as written sixteen long and tempestuous years ago. I have mixed feelings
  about some of these old pieces, written before my Wilderness Years, and I can identify
  a difference in my method, given that then I was writing for the page, whereas now
  I am ever conscious that I will be reading aloud. Anyway, here it is. Make of it
  what you will. Oh, and please note that Dobson, the private detective who appears
  here, is by no means to be confused with his namesake, the titanic, albeit out of
  print, twentieth century pamphleteer.

  Originally published by Thwack & Rudder Ltd in 1926, The Book Of Gnats was written
  by the noted aviatrix and explorer Maud Glubb (1873-1958). Well-known for her countless
  newspaper articles, travelogues, and often indiscreet prefaces to other people''s
  books, Glubb wrote this--her only work of fiction--by the sputtering light of blubber
  candles during the ill-starred Bilgegrew Antarctic Expedition of 1911.

  Captain Gervase Bilgegrew of the Royal Scrofulous Hussars was, according to the
  Dictionary Of National Biography, "perhaps the most incompetent person ever to lead
  a polar expedition". On the very day the explorers set out from the sprightly little
  port of Mobster, Bilgegrew burned all the charts, broke the compass, contaminated
  the pemmican supply, and blinded the medical officer. At the Commission of Enquiry
  held in 1913 upon the expedition''s return, he first insisted that these were unfortunate
  accidents, later changing his story under cross-examination to plead that he was
  only trying to run a tight ship and to instil a sense of discipline into his crew.
  The full story of the disastrous expedition is told in Curwen''s Polar Hebetude
  : To The End Of The Earth With A Halfwit, to which the reader is referred.

  Glubb herself did not return to her homeland until 1919, for reasons which remain
  shrouded in mystery. Some reports have her leading rebel troops in the Tantarabim
  Revolution of 1915, but they are unsubstantiated. Glubb herself never spoke of this
  missing period in her life. Her biographer Gravel Slobber, despite years of prodigious
  research, finally conceded that "we are unlikely ever to learn precisely what happened
  to Glubb during this period".

  Slobber notes that the great aviatrix never intended The Book Of Gnats for publication.
  The manuscript was stored in a huge mahogany casket in the belvedere of a country
  house in which Glubb''s friend Laburnum Bails worked as a piano-tuner.  Interviewed
  shortly before her death in 1968, Bails said that the text would have remained forever
  locked away had it not been for the intervention of Crocus Thwack, sister of the
  notorious publisher, toad-collector, and sot Wenceslas Thwack. Like her brother,
  Crocus was both an alcoholic and a kleptomaniac. At a weekend party hosted by Bails''
  employer, she jemmied open the casket in the mistaken assumption that it contained
  a hidden supply of negus. Finding instead the manuscript of The Book Of Gnats, she
  stole it and later passed it on to her brother in exchange for a crate of grog.

  Why was Wenceslas Thwack interested in a virtually illegible stack of pages, each
  one blackened by blubber-smoke? Neither Bails nor Slobber can offer an adequate
  answer. Of course, Glubb was a public figure, and the newspapers often carried reports
  of her latest exploits, but Thwack & Rudder Ltd had never published any fiction
  before. In those novel-choked years, they had gained a reputation for issuing only
  ecclesiastical tracts, bell-ringing manuals, and massive, erudite, unreadable multi-volume
  works on the obscurer by-ways of ichthyology.

  Whatever his reasons, Thwack wrote to Glubb seeking her permission to publish. By
  return of post, he received an extraordinary reply, thanking him profusely, commending
  his almost superhuman literary judgement, allowing him to edit the manuscript as
  he saw fit, and instructing him to pay all the author''s royalties to a charitable
  institution for retired skindivers. Glubb always insisted that this letter was a
  forgery, and pursued Thwack through the courts. In February 1928, two years after
  the book was published, she won her case. Thwack & Rudder''s remaining stock was
  pulped. Glubb herself employed a private detective named Dobson to track down and
  destroy all other copies of the book.

  A lesser man would have blanched at the prospect, but not Dobson. Within hours of
  accepting the job, he burgled the publisher''s offices, coming away with sales ledgers,
  files, invoices, receipts, and threatening letters. His agents fanned out across
  the country, burning down bookshops, terrorising librarians, and breaking into houses
  at dead of night. They staked out junk shops, bazaars, and jumble sales. Week by
  week, Dobson stuck pins into the enormous map on the wall of his office, as more
  and more copies were traced, purloined, ignited, and obliterated. He sent to Glubb
  regular monthly reports, detailing successes, setback, near-misses, and red herrings.
  When her money ran out, and she could no longer pay him, Dobson financed the operation
  himself.

  By November 1934, the task was complete. Thwack & Rudder had printed ten thousand
  copies of The Book Of Gnats, and there were ten thousand pins in Dobson''s map.
  A celebration fireworks party was held, Glubb and Dobson personally thanking all
  the agents who had been so unstinting in their efforts. As they sipped cocktails
  and exchanged anecdotes, reliving the high points of the great pursuit, one agent
  remained strangely quiet, preoccupied. Ned Mudbag harboured a terrible doubt. One
  morning in July 1931, waking up in a grim hotel in Pugwash Magna, Mudbag had an
  attack of the jangles. He was barely able to make it to the lobby. The standard
  procedure, with jangles, was to send Dobson a coded telegram, explaining that the
  agent would be out of action for a couple of days. Dobson was an understanding man.
  Usually, he would arrange for a bouquet of nasturtiums to be delivered, accompanied
  by a sympathetic note. On the other hand, if for any reason there was a particular
  urgency in the case, he would have another agent move in, flamethrower at the ready.

  That hot and agonising morning, Mudbag had not sent a telegram. Instead, his brain
  befuddled, he subcontracted the work to a complete stranger he met on the pavement
  outside the hotel. It was madness. It was contrary to all his instructions, to everything
  Dobson had ever taught him. Three years on, poor Mudbag could still not understand
  what on earth had made him do it. Yes, the stranger had seemed trustworthy. Yes,
  he had cradled Mudbag in his arms and helped him back up to his room. Yes, he had
  spoon-fed him custard and mopped his fevered brow. But there was no excuse, and
  Mudbag knew it, and he had never had the courage to admit what he had done. The
  worst thing was the nagging doubt. He could never be absolutely certain that the
  copy of the book he was tracking that day had actually been destroyed.

  Ironically, in view of what happened, the stranger was trustworthy. He listened
  attentively as Mudbag babbled the details of the task at hand. He swore that he
  would tell no one, and he never did. He even gave away the crumpled banknote which
  Mudbag thrust into his hands as payment, to a pockmarked mendicant loitering outside
  the hotel. The stranger had only one flaw--he was severely myopic. He nearly missed
  the library, entering the municipal baths by mistake, but a passing Jesuit steered
  him in the right direction. After an hour of squinting and peering along the shelves,
  the stranger located the book--or so he supposed--deftly concealed it under his
  mackintosh, walked out of the library, caught a bus to the town dump, and, unnoticed
  by the superintendent, tossed on to a blazing bonfire the stolen tome--a 1912 reprint
  of Schmidlapp''s The Ambiguity Of Indigestion.

  And so the sole surviving copy of The Book Of Gnats remained, unborrowed, on the
  shelves of the Pugwash Magna Public Library until 1952, when it was withdrawn from
  stock and donated, together with some forty other books, to the Cardinal Preen Mercy
  Home For Demented Paupers. When that institution was closed down in 1966, its library
  was auctioned off, and The Book Of Gnats was part of a job-lot bought by Grimes
  Pugh, a secondhand book dealer with a shop in Hooting Yard. Pugh died in 1973, and
  his business was taken over, after much wrangling, by Dr F X Duggleby MD, who had
  been struck off the medical register in the same year for the illicit prescription
  of nose-drops. Duggleby''s new career as a bookseller was not a success, and on
  New Year''s Eve 1976 he closed up the shop, drank four pints of stout in a seedy
  tavern, threw himself into a canal, and drowned. The shop was boarded up and the
  property condemned. Three days before demolition, a big van pulled up outside, and
  took away the mildewed and rotting books which were piled in tottering heaps in
  the store-room.

  Most of the stock ended up in a furnace, but sharp-eyed scavengers plucked out the
  few books which were salvageable. The Book Of Gnats was one of them. Eventually,
  by who knows what twists and turns, it found its way to a charity shop in Pancakes,
  where, on the fourteenth of January 1987, I bought it for tuppence.

  When, some weeks later, I read the book, I was thunderstruck. It seemed to me to
  be a work of art of the highest quality, tantalising, majestic, profound, and valiant.
  Since that first, delirious reading, I have not shifted one jot from my opinion.
  At that time I did not know the curious history of Maud Glubb''s masterpiece, but
  it did not take me long to discover that the book was long out of print, and unknown
  to seemingly all my literate and well-read cronies, who are legion. I should explain
  that I am, like Wenceslas Thwack, a publisher.

  I think it was during the foul autumn of 1988 that I decided to issue a new edition
  of The Book Of Gnats. The previous summer had seen two of my titles sell in unexpectedly
  high quantities, and for once I was flush with money. I envisaged a deluxe edition,
  bound in some exotic, and possibly illegal, animal hide, with a cover design by
  the noted gouacheist Scrimgeour, a learned introduction by myself, and an exhaustive
  commentary by Glubb''s biographer Slobber.

  I am a woman of considerable integrity, and I did not wish to tempt the fate of
  Thwack''s edition by neglecting to seek permission from the copyright holders. Like
  most people, I was aware that Maud Glubb had met her death on the sixth of February
  1958. She had accompanied the Busby Babes to their European Cup tie against Red
  Star Belgrade, and on the return journey, she perished, along with the flower of
  postwar British football, in the Munich Air Disaster. Apocryphal it may be, but
  I have heard that Sir Matt Busby''s first words after the crash, on coming to in
  the hospital ward, were "Glubb... Glubb... Glubb".

  Glubb had died intestate, and she had no close relatives. The lawyers discovered
  that she appeared to have no distant relatives either. Despite the publicity surrounding
  her death, and a series of public announcements, notices in the press, and radio
  bulletins, no on ever came forward to lay claim to her estate. No one, that is,
  except patent frauds, such as a twelve-year-old boy from Idaho named Biff, or Chump,
  or something like that, who was swiftly revealed to be the victim of an experiment
  in mesmerism, his actions controlled by a sinister mastermind bent on world domination.
  This shadowy figure was apprehended and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Biff,
  or Chump, freed from his entrancement, returned to Idaho and when last heard of
  was a "soda jerk", although quite what such a trade involves is  not known to me.

  Control of Glubb''s literary estate fell, by who knows what arcane legal mechanism,
  into the hands of a Dutch businessman named Jan Van Der Strob. There! I have written
  down the name of the monster who has reduced my life to misery, and--worse, far
  worse--has deprived the world of the opportunity to read The Book Of Gnats in its
  entirety. The three fragments reproduced below, to which this essay forms an introduction,
  are all that remain of this work of towering genius. How so? Read on, and I will
  tell you.

  On Christmas Eve 1988 I received, via a telephone call, the information I had been
  awaiting, impatiently, for weeks. Tracking down Glubb''s literary executor had been
  ludicrously difficult, but now at last I had a name and address. I fired off a letter
  to Van Der Strob at once, introducing myself, outlining my credentials, and proposing
  terms for the right to publish Glubb''s only work of fiction. It was a polite, businesslike
  letter, and I popped it in the postbox on Christmas morning.

  On New Year''s Eve, a sniper perched on a rooftop across the street shot me in the
  leg as I dandled my grandchild on my knee. Seconds later, almost before I began
  to howl, I heard the unmistakeable sound of a helicopter, whirring above my house.
  It disgorged a troop of black-clad commandos who shimmied down rope ladders, kicked
  in the window, already shattered by the sniper''s bullet, and tumbled into my sitting-room,
  panting and snorting like hogs. In my mind''s eye I see dozens of them, but I suppose
  there can only have been four or five. My grandchild scuttled for safety behind
  a large armchair. I was curled up on the floor, wailing hysterically and making
  rather a spectacle of myself. To my surprise, the commandos ignored me. Instead,
  they rampaged about the place, overturning furniture, smashing my ornaments, and
  hurling books across the room.

  "Gnats?!" shouted one, in a foreign accent. This was the first indication that the
  mayhem was in any way connected to Maud Glubb''s masterpiece, but I was in too much
  of a state to notice it at the time. The commandos spent another half-hour laying
  waste my house before departing through the windows, haring up their rope ladders
  into the helicopter, which whirled them away as suddenly as they had come.

  This extraordinary circumstance remained a mystery to me until some days later.
  The gunshot wound, though bloody, was superficial, and I was discharged from hospital
  after a few hours. I spent the first days of 1989 clearing up the mess of my home.
  Then, on the fourth of January, I received another visit. This time, at least, my
  caller used a more conventional means of entry--he knocked at the door and waited
  to be allowed in. He even had a visiting-card, an old-fashioned touch of which I
  approved. As he stood, snuffling, in the porch, I read it:

  Gulliver Whitlow. UK agent for Van Der Strob International Enterprises GmbH.

  Still with no thought in my head that the influenza-wracked gentleman in my porch
  had any connection with snipers or commandos, I invited him in to my sitting-room.
  How engaging, I remember thinking, for Van Der Strob to send a personal emissary!
  I was to be rapidly disillusioned. Whitlow refused to sit down.

  "Madam," he said thickly, "I believe you are in possession of a copy of The Book
  Of Gnats by Maud Glubb, published by Thwack & Rudder Ltd in 1926. Is my information
  correct?"

  I nodded.

  "Our crack squad of commandos, augmented by a sniper, failed to discover this book
  when they called on you some days ago. Hence my visit. I must insist that you hand
  over to me the book, together with any photostats and what have you, this very instant."

  You will have little difficulty imagining the pirouettes which took place in my
  brain. Let us leap forward a minute or two. I have regained my composure, at least
  outwardly.

  "The book is not in my possession, Mr Whitlow," I announced.

  "Do not dally with me, madam."

  "The book is not in this house. If it was, sir, surely your band of thugs would
  have found it?"

  "Commandos, madam, not thugs. Commandos." He sneezed.

  "Bless you," I said. I have always set great store by politeness.

  "Very well," spluttered Whitlow, holding a surprisingly dainty handkerchief over
  his mouth, "Where then is The Book Of Gnats?"

  "In a safe deposit box in an important bank," I replied.

  I did not intend to divulge any further details, and half-expected Mr Whitlow to
  start behaving like a comic-book villain, threatening me with unimaginable violence
  unless I spilled the beans. Instead, still snuffling, he asked me if I had such
  a thing as a mentholated lozenge. I told him that I allowed no suckable medicaments
  into my house.

  "In that case, madam, I must bid you farewell," he said. I showed him to the door,
  and he was gone.

  In the next three days, every important bank in the city was looted by a gang of
  skilled thieves. The police were mightily puzzled by the fact that safe deposit
  boxes containing gold, jewels, cash, treasures and compromising documents were emptied,
  but their contents left strewn in heaps in the vaults. Nothing at all, it seemed,
  was actually stolen. The newspapers hushed up this bizarre series of non-robberies,
  so I did not find out about them until it was too late. On the third day, of course,
  Van Der Strob''s criminal minions located my box, found my copy of The Book Of Gnats,
  and made off with it. To this day, I have failed to recover it. I am a woman bereft.
  You, who tragically have not read this magnificent work, may sympathise with my
  plight, but you cannot truly understand it.

  One day in February, I received a letter from Van Der Strob himself. All innocence,
  he wrote that unfortunately he was unable to grant me permission to reissue Maud
  Glubb''s book, for reasons bound up with the legal intricacies of her estate. Then,
  pencilled in as a P.S., showing his true colours, the Dutch hellhound added, "As
  for the manuscript, I personally incinerated it. Heh heh heh!" The wretch! One day,
  ah, one day I shall pay someone to assassinate him.

  After a prolonged stay in a Home for the Bewildered, I set about rebuilding my life.
  I published books on ducks, spinets, and the Great Dismal Maroons. But Glubb--or
  rather, her book--continues to haunt me. If only I had a good memory! I could recreate
  her timeless words in my head, and damn Van Der Strob to perdition. But all that
  remains of The Book Of Gnats are three paragraphs which, for some forgotten reason,
  I copied out on to the crumpled wrapper of a boiled sweet in miniature writing during
  a thunderstorm in the summer of 1987. This scrap evaded the clutches of Van Der
  Strob''s brutish pack, shoved as it was, unregarded, in the tiniest drawer of my
  escritoire.

  I transcribe the sorry fragments below, and I weep.

  I -- So was a tempest loosed upon the city, and its very fabric uprooted from the
  mud. Whirling and howling, the city was dispersed upon the firmament, coming to
  rest none knew where. And the mud spawned all manner of noisome pests, squirming
  and wriggling to escape the gigantic puddles which were left in the wake of the
  storm. These were not puddles of water, no, nor of any liquid known to the human
  mind. And then my eyes saw, standing fiery on a wooden plinth ringed by scum-pools,
  the obscene figure of Winckelmann. In his left hand he brandished aloft a scrap
  of burning linoleum. His right hand was made into a fist. As, dribbling, I watched,
  the fist was slowly opened to reveal a...... I cannot say. I do not know. For just
  at the moment my peering, watery eyes would have seen that... that thing, I was
  startled by a toad, which leapt up at my face, and thwacked me on the forehead,
  leaving an imprint which remains there to this day, like a brand.

  II -- The man with the toad-mark flapped his shattered wings. In vain, in vain.
  Perched on the rock, beaten by harsh winds, encrusted with seaweed, sightless, he
  was of a sudden assaulted by a voice, roaring at him across a thousand continents.
  "Man with the Mark of the Toad! Know ye the Song of the Boll Weevils? Aye? Then
  sing, damn ye, sing!" Whence came that monstrous voice? What hideous nursery had
  cosseted its owner, what kitchen fed it? "Man with the Mark of the Toad!" it screamed
  again, pulverizing universes, "Hare ye to me now, leave your drab rock! Shed your
  cracked wings! Sprout fins, smack the boiling sea with your flippers, come to me!
  I hold in my gnarled, gnarled hands many gifts for you! I hold anconeal bowls! I
  hold strangled curlews! I hold pods and gum and pitchblende! Spring forward now!
  Go from your dour perch! I hold magnification instruments, Coddington lenses, and
  towels for you! I hold pigeons'' blood, crayons and isinglass! The crayons are of
  colours no human eye should ever contemplate! The isinglass gleams in a charming
  handmade jar! The jar has your mark upon it, Man with the Mark of the Toad! Come..."
  There were hours upon hours of this wretched gibberish, enough to make an ant die.
  The man with the toad-mark beat his useless wings against the wind and turned his
  head away. His brow was crawling with gnats. The gnats had come a long way, from
  barely imaginable puddles of slop where once a city had stood. The City of Gnats.

  III -- Winckelmann strode importantly through the boulevards of the walled city.
  He chucked trinkets and baubles to beggars and cripples, holding a vermilion cravat
  over his nose as he did so. Worms slithered up his dainty anklets, only to be torn
  away by scrofula-ridden flunkies. Imposing but haphazard, Winckelmann relied upon
  his most trusted attendant to lead him in the right direction. These boulevards
  all looked alike to him. He could be going anywhere, were it not for Sigismundo''s
  genius. As a factotum, he was a treasure. Save for his inexplicable habit of pissing
  on coinage, Sigismundo was faultless. In this warren of pestilent streets, he knew
  precisely what to do. Turn right by the trough; ignore the screeching placardists;
  beat the pedlars insensible with their own clubs; smartly avoid the motorbikes.
  Before long, Winckelmann and his retinue stood in the courtyard of the Impossibly
  Huge Building. The stink was repellent, but Winckelmann knew etiquette if he knew
  nothing else. With an effort, he removed the cravat from his nose and, at a signal
  from Sigismundo, pushed an envelope stuffed full of flies into the grubby hand of
  the waiting serjeant-at-arms. A ludicrous ballet of bows and scrapes took place,
  Sigismundo taking photographs the while. After what seemed like hours, Winckelmann
  was ushered into an inner chamber. His attendant was not allowed to accompany him.
  Without his trusted lackey at his side, Winckelmann was a little nervous, but his
  discomfiture did not last long. No more than fifteen seconds passed before he was
  greeted by his hosts--a swarm of gigantic gnats, whose thrashing wings knocked Winckelmann
  mercifully unconscious before they devoured him, every last bit of him, grinding
  him to dust between their powerful biting jaws. It was over in a flash. Then, buzzing
  and twanging, the swarm left the chamber as it had entered, through a chute, through
  a chute, through a chute.'
