full_text: 'MR BEWG''S REFERENCE

  Here is a slightly revised version of a very old story, which first appeared in
  Twitching And Shattered two decades ago. I''m posting it here today for no reason
  other than mere whim.

  Dear Mr Corncrake,

  Re : MR B BEWG, 6 DISMAL TERRACE, HOON

  Thank you for your letter of 20th July regarding the above-named; I am happy to
  provide him with a reference.

  I have known Mr Bewg for ten years, ever since he took up the position of scrivener,
  dogsbody and wretch in my vast, gloomy factory perched on the hillside next to the
  lunatic asylum. At the time I engaged Mr Bewg I suspected that he had some connection
  with the latter institution, and in  the decade since I have had no reason to alter
  my opinion.

  You ask me to comment on my impression of Mr Bewg''s "suitability for the job".
  Forgive me if I find this difficult. I do not wish to do violence to our native
  language, but to use the word "suitability" in conjunction with Mr  Bewg is to mock
  the Queen''s English. Indeed, it is to make a mockery of sense itself.

  My problems with Mr Bewg began on his very first morning in my employ. To settle
  him in, I had instructed him to carry out a menial task, removing bits of goo from
  the interior walls of a vat. To facilitate his progress, he was supplied with a
  variety of tools, including a pencil-sharpener, a pin-cushion, and a decidedly ferocious
  blowtorch. No sooner had I turned my back than Mr Bewg became embroiled in a tussle
  with my pet panther, which--crazed with hunger--managed to slip its leash and embed
  its razor-sharp fangs in his left leg. For this impertinence I had no option but
  to dock Mr Bewg his first month''s wages.

  It was not a good start, but I had had many a ne''er-do-well working for me in the
  past, and believed that I could yet mould Mr Bewg into a marginally less repellent
  specimen of human dregs. To this end, I assigned him to work in the filthiest, dankest
  wing of the factory, where he was expected to spend all day dragging sacks full
  of huge iron lumps backwards and forwards in infested tunnels for no apparent purpose.
  So ineptly did Mr Bewg execute his duties that I was forced to withhold his pay
  for a further year. I wrung my hands in frustration, but the man was impossible.
  Given a simple task, he would be utterly incapable of completing it with the requisite
  speed, good humour and fawning obeisance that one expects.

  To take just one example: Mr Bewg failed to budge one particularly heavy sack, containing
  a score of medium-sized anvils, a single inch, despite being given all of five minutes
  to drag it two hundred yards along a stinking tunnel in which small bonfires of
  sulphur had been ignited moments before. I set a wolfhound yapping at his heels,
  but to no avail. The man was purely and simply work-shy.

  But I am a fair employer, and I had no wish to consign him to the scrapheap of the
  unemployable and useless. Instead, I agreed with Mr Bewg that he could embark upon
  a training scheme. In return for a modest fee to be paid to me daily, in cash, I
  offered to provide him with a comprehensive course in a multiplicity of disciplines,
  both within the factory and in the adjoining administrative hellhole. In the first
  week alone, we covered a huge range of skills; licking my boots till they shone,
  prostrating himself on his stomach whenever I came within his sight, and dribbling
  with happiness at the mention of my name.

  At this stage in what can only roughly be called his "career", Mr Bewg crawled into
  my palatial office one day to request my assistance with a personal matter. Tempted
  though I was to have him savaged by mastiffs, I reclined in my unbelievably comfortable
  executive armchair and heard him out. He confessed that he was in some financial
  difficulty and begged me to help. Sipping my glass of ruinously expensive wine,
  I delivered a stern lecture on the virtue of thrift and beat him about the skull
  with a copy of Self Help by Samuel Smiles. I admitted that I was in a position to
  repay his paltry debts a billionfold if I was minded to, but that such a course
  of action  would not in the long run be of the slightest benefit to him. I then
  advised him that he could earn a few extra pence by selling various of his bodily
  organs and thus better his financial situation while basking in the knowledge that
  he was being self-reliant rather than coming cap-in-hand to his employer.

  To prove my point, I offered to buy one of his kidneys and three pints of his blood
  on the spot, for which I would pay him fourpence. As the bulk of his debts were
  monies owed to me, I generously deducted the fourpence from his account. In this
  way, I was able to relieve him of the responsibility of handling any cash himself,
  and thereby falling prey to the inevitable temptation to fritter the money away
  on food, clothing, or medicine. Only after this transaction had taken place did
  I set the mastiffs on him.

  Not long after this incident, Mr Bewg announced that he had found himself  another
  job, and wished to resign. lf his inane burbling was to be believed, he had been
  offered the position of assistant slave at a charnel-house, the main duties being
  to crawl on his hands and knees in foul pits of ordure. As I listened patiently,
  he explained that he felt this post would give him opportunities undreamed of in
  his current position, and that he was prepared to take a cut in salary in order
  to take up the offer. Poking at him with a stick, I nodded my consent. I had no
  wish to stand in his way. My only concern was that he would have the decency to
  fulfil the terms and conditions of his contract before setting off for pastures
  new. I then reminded him of the form he had signed on his first day at the factory,
  the main clauses being that in order to leave, he would have to give forty years''
  notice and to repay every single penny of his wages since day one. To my surprise,
  Mr Bewg (who moments before had been adamant that he wished to leave) said that
  he would like a few days to think about it. Once again I nodded my assent, then
  summoned fourteen of my myrmidons, who bundled Mr Bewg out of my office and set
  him to work on his latest task, which was to lie face down in a muddy ditch while
  a herd of demented bison charged over him.

  In view of the above, I must add that I cannot in truth recommend Mr Bewg to you.
  His work is shoddy, his attendance and punctuality leave much to be desired, and
  I have the gravest doubts about his character. His sickness record is appalling,
  and I have been put in the uncomfortable position of having to threaten various
  members of the medical profession with violence after they were so irresponsible
  as to provide MrA Bewg with certificates. However, should you decide to ignore my
  warnings and offer a job to Mr Bewg, he will be available for work upon completion
  of his notice period, in forty years'' time.

  Yours sincerely,

  B Git



  SOUP : A CHEWIST TEXT

  (For a definition of Chewism, see 2nd March)

  The subject of today''s harangue is the preparation of soup, so pin back your nasty
  fat little purple ears and listen carefully. The following directions will be found
  generally applicable, so that there will be no need to repeat the several details
  each time. In any case, I will distribute written notes later, and this time I am
  feeling magnanimous, so they will be legible. Seasonings are not specified, as these
  are a matter of individual taste and circumstance. Some people think I am overfond
  of very, very hot mustard, and thus blame me for everything from trivial lip-burns
  to years spent in a lazaretto--pah! Some from considerations of health or otherwise
  are forbidden the use of salt. Sissies. In such cases a little sugar will help to
  bring out the flavour of the vegetables, but unless all the members of the household
  are alike, it had best not be added before bringing to table. Anyway, at first glance
  salt and sugar look almost identical, so one ruse is to dim the lanterns or to light
  a batch of blubber-candles, the fumes from which will be acrid enough to divert
  your diners'' attention. Where soup is to be strained, whole pepper, mace, &c.,
  is much preferable to ground, both as being free from adulteration, and giving all
  the flavour without the grit. Some soup recipes, of course, call for the inclusion
  of handfuls of grit, dust, and pavement grease, so bear that in mind. The water
  in which cauliflower, green peas, &c., have been boiled, should be added to the
  stock-pot, but as we are now recognising that all vegetables should be cooked as
  conservatively as possible--that is, by steaming, or in just as much water as they
  will absorb, so as not to waste the valuable salts and juices, there will not be
  much of such liquid in a ''Reform'' menage. Any water you do use is best brought
  to kitchen in an iron pail direct from the closest duckpond, for springs and even
  wells harbour all sorts of tiny little beasties with far too many legs, and even
  wings, whereas all such creepy-crawlies will have been removed from a duckpond by
  the eating habits of hungry and none-too-fastidious ducks. A stock must therefore
  be made from fresh materials, but as those are comparatively inexpensive, we need
  not grudge having them of the freshest and best. Try never to eat anything that
  is more than five years old. Readers of Thackeray will remember the little dinner
  at Timmins, when the hired chef shed such consternation in the bosom of little Mrs
  Timmins by his outrageous demands for ''a leg of beef, a leg of veal, and a ham'',
  on behalf of the stock-pot. Those who do not know their Thackeray will wonder what
  in heaven''s name I am talking about, but the point is plain: every kitchen must
  have a bound set of Victorian novels--wrapped in greaseproof paper--to avert the
  unexpected.

  Text by Marigold Chew & Mrs J. O. Mill from the fourth edition of The Reform Cookery
  Book (1909)


  FRUSTUM, TANG, SLUICE

  One of Confidential Agent Blot''s earlier investigative triumphs was cracking the
  case of the dishevelled marmalade man. Let us recall the facts. The whinnying of
  horses had disturbed the sleep of the little village of Spraingue for two months.
  There was a damp, hideous thing in the corner of the post office that none dared
  approach. Perhaps most jarring of all, an illegal cafeteria had been built slap
  in the middle of the village, surrounded by menacing guard dogs whose fangs glistened
  in the moonlight. Agent Blot arrived on the scene on a Tuesday afternoon frantic
  with gales. His dazzling cone-shaped hat made the villagers wonder what frustum
  it had once topped. His complexion was paler, more drawn and anguished than usual,
  possibly because a change in diet had given him a recent attack of the seeds, from
  which he was not yet fully recovered. His breath was tanged with the fumes of his
  weird pills, those tiny pink spangles Dr Glag had insisted upon. Agent Blot commandeered
  an abandoned birdseed silo as his headquarters, and subjected every single villager
  to a lengthy interrogation. His manner was charming but curiously unnerving. The
  clinic was soon filled with haunted-looking patients demanding to have their brains
  sluiced with Baxter''s Terrible Fluid. By Saturday afternoon, with no let up in
  the gales, Spraingue had an air of almost Biblical calamity. And yet, and yet...
  as soon as his last interview was done with, Agent Blot sprang upon the dishevelled
  marmalade man and carted him off to the dungeon in his cave. The horses'' whinnying
  ceased. The thing in the post office evaporated. A law was passed to make the cafeteria
  legal, and the dogs bounded away across the hills, their atrocious yapping growing
  ever fainter, until it could no longer be heard at all.


  SCENES FROM THE LIVES OF THE POETS : 1. MAUD ABDAB

  My name is Maud Abdab. I am the woman who ate blood oranges with Enver Hoxha. We
  sat together in uncomfortable beach chairs, without speaking. My Albanian was rusty,
  and I was in awe, and he saw I was in awe, and he relished my awe. Juice from the
  blood oranges dribbled down our jaws. From the discomfort of his beach chair, Enver
  Hoxha directed my attention to the left. I looked, and saw a rowing boat, and the
  rowing boat''s oars. The oars were too small for the rowing boat--or--the rowing
  boat was too big for the oars. I turned to look at Enver Hoxha. After a pause, he
  rose, and pulled from his pocket a length of gauze. When he went, he shook my hand,
  but he did not let fall the gauze. He spoke then. He said he had to go and draft
  some new Albanian laws. I recall nothing more.


  CUPPID

  Cuppid is, as you might expect, related to Cupid, although there is a lot more than
  that extra P to help you distinguish between them. Cuppid is composed of both toxic
  and non-toxic gases, and tinkles a little golden bell whenever it alights upon the
  hairy back of a bison, which it often does, for Cuppid''s favourite haunts are the
  vast plains of North America. I say it because Cuppid is, if not exactly a hermaphrodite,
  neither male nor female, although sometimes when its gases cool and take on liquid
  form it can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sonja Henie (1912-1969), the legendary
  Norwegian figure skating champion. Such moments can be dangerous for Cuppid, for
  it is volatile, and seeks warmer air urgently to return to its gaseous state.

  Cuppid is invoked by farmers and by those who work with timber, for it brings them
  luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by Cuppid,
  and tremble at its approach. You can be sure that if you see a trembling plutocrat,
  Cuppid is not far away.

  Some say Cuppid can be trapped in an envelope or small carton and used for both
  good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever
  been verified.

  Toy plastic Cuppids, coated with a special varnish to ape the appearance of gas,
  have recently become popular as gifts for children in Dawlish, Oswestry and Uttoxeter.
  This geographical exclusivity is due to factors unique to Cuppid, including the
  risk of suffocation, impending thirst, and three or four empty metal pails lined
  up in a row on the site of a long ago mudslide.

  Cuppid rotates.


  Left : Cupid. Right : Sonja Henie, or possibly Cuppid at low temperature.


  THE HAPLESS BIVALVE!

  Here is another example of the Incoherent Twaddle Generation Method. This also dates
  from 1987, and is again from a decisively out of print Malice Aforethought Press
  pamphlet, Forty Visits To The Worm Farm, a story which also appears in Twitching
  And Shattered (1989) and in This Fish Is Loaded : The Book Of Surreal And Bizarre
  Humour, edited by Richard Glyn Jones (Xanadu, 1991).

  The glands of the investing tissue secrete lime and deposit it always submerged.
  These arrest the spat at the moment of emission. They detach with a hook the piles
  covered with fascines and branches, if we can use the term, buried in the sands
  or mud, their polypiferous portion sallying into the water. The raches, roughened
  and furrowed down the middle with pointed spiculae, or tubercular ramifications
  prolonged in a straight canal, the columellar edge sometimes callous--this is the
  critical moment for the hapless bivalve! He seizes it with a three-pronged fork,
  aiding also the functions of the stomach, filled with villainous green matter, which
  is conical, swollen in the middle, diminished, and tapers off, producing new beings,
  covered with vibratile cilia, furnished with two fins, limited only by the length
  of the stem, but in a moment beginning to dissolve its corporation, a soft reticulated
  crust, or bark, full of little cavities. The hinder ones loosen their hold, with
  four or six rows of ambulacral pieces designated by the names compass, plumula,
  bristling envelope, levelled bayonets, smothered. Last come the terrible and multiplied
  engines of calcareous immovable thread-like cirrhi with transverse bands, many of
  which crumble. Sometimes they are dredged.

  ADDENDUM : I note that Amazon has copies of This Fish Is Loaded for sale from $0.47.
  Alongside Mr Key, the book includes work by Woody Allen, Mervyn Peake, Vivian Stanshall,
  Alfred Jarry, Bob Dylan, and the great, great Leonora Carrington (and many more,
  not least Yoko Ono''s late husband).'
