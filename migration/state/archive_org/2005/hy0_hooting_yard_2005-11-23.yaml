  Pansy Cradledew has recently become enamoured of the computer game Bosanquet, which
  she will play for hours at a time, seemingly removed from an earthly plane. Though
  I do not share her enthusiasm for this so-called "game of skill, tactics, problem-solving
  and strategy", Pansy assures me that she is but one among a legion of devotees.
  She also says that, as an expert player, she wants to reach out to those less adept
  than herself, and has asked me to publish a few little hints and tips.

  "These should not be considered as something so vulgar as ''cheats''," she writes,
  "but as advisory notes for those Bosanquetistas (as we dub ourselves) who have not
  yet reached the exalted level in which I bask."

  Here, then, is an edited version of the dozens upon dozens of pages of scribbled
  jottings Pansy sent in:

  Tranche 6 : The Rushdie can be placated by moving the cursor over the red squares
  next to the pond. There is a squirrel hidden under the canopy. Press CTRL-SHIFT
  repeatedly to capture the goat.

  Tranche 11 : To avoid the bees, hold down all the numeric keys and move your avatar
  to the square beside the pillows.

  Tranche 43 : The ice-field is really a devil''s pit. Get past it by collecting all
  sixteen nougat-bags.

  Tranche 49 : My fastest time at this tranche is a whopping four hours thirty six
  minutes. Remember that to pass the crepuscular nozzles you have to bring your sack
  of V S Naipaul novels from the previous tranche.

  Tranche 60 : Martin Amis can only be beheaded by using the cursor to drag the sword
  across the blobs.

  Tranche 144 : Hit the arrow keys in this order :UP-UP-UP-LEFT-LEFT-UP-RIGHT-DOWN.
  This will take you to the lair of the savage brontosaurus and you will be able to
  swallow the magic potion. Be careful of the magnetic locusts.

  If Pansy''s "advisory notes" are to be believed, there are at least two hundred
  more tranches to complete, but that is quite enough of this nonsense.


  KNITTED BULGARIAN FOLK TALE PUPPET

  Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us readers
  a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that Olympics logo.
  Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial conclave, and
  to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed Blunkettite. The
  real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate to find out what Mrs
  Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?

  Well, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by
  a charity working with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels
  out Pointy Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower
  than the lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even
  the most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because, you
  know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for them,
  and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts--if they actually have
  beating human hearts--by making for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo, hero
  of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.

  We have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would be
  an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh,
  some three years after they originally appeared:

  Ugo Goofs Off

  Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. "There you go, Ugo, goofing off
  again," said Ugo''s ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on his
  boots. "Ma, I''ve got goo on my boots," said Ugo. Ugo''s ma gave him a rag to wipe
  the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags. Ugo''s ma
  was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened the drawer
  of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a gewgaw, for if
  she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn''t get the goo off his boots, but with a rag he
  would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the goo off his boots with
  a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pal Ulf

  In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo, Ugo,"
  said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma made him
  a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf''s bubo. In
  the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo''s ma brought
  food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. "Far be
  it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo''s ma, "But you should put the pancake
  on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo
  was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could
  cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could do. For the
  time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pod

  In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo''s ma said, "Ugo,
  why are you using a pod instead of a jar?" Ugo''s ma was blind, but she knew that
  the plop of Ugo''s pod was different to the plop of his jar. "Oh, ma," said Ugo,
  "My jar is in the shed." Ugo''s ma bashed Ugo on the head. "Never leave your jar
  in the shed, Ugo," she said, "When you do I will bash you on the head, as I just
  did." Ugo said, "Sorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed." "Ah," said Ugo''s
  ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s New Hooter

  Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his
  blind ma''s ear. "Ooh, Ugo," said Ugo''s ma, "That hooter makes a din!" "It''s a
  hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize," said Ugo. "And what did your pal Ulf win,
  Ugo?" asked Ugo''s ma, shelling peas as she spoke. "Ulf won a toy wolf, ma," said
  Ugo, "It''s as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb
  on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars." Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran
  off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Turns Blue

  It was Saint Hector''s Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo''s hood got snagged on
  a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. "Oooo" said Ugo''s
  pal Ulf, "Ugo, you look all blue." "Ack" said Ugo. "I''ll go and fetch your blind
  ma, Ugo, to see what she can do," said Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo''s hood
  off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found
  Ugo''s ma sitting on a stool. "Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "Ugo has turned blue. His hood
  is snagged on a tack." Ugo''s ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool
  and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo''s ma spat out her chew, and it landed
  in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo''s pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo''s ma unsnagged
  Ugo''s hood from the tack. "Ack" said Ugo. "Ooo, Ugo''s ma, I knew you would know
  what to do," said Ulf. Ugo''s ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon, and confiscated
  his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass. At Saint Hector''s
  Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Goes Loopy

  One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the
  yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo''s
  blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started to
  sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo''s ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a goose!"
  Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo''s pal Ulf, who came tumbling
  into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that you, Ugo''s
  pal Ulf?" asked Ugo''s ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is a shrew and a
  goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo''s ma. "No, Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "It''s only
  Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo''s ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo''s pal Ulf off to
  school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.


  EPITAPH FOR A QUACK

  Over at The Dabbler, Gaw has been taking a stroll through the "tended decadence"
  of Abney Park Cemetery, prompting Nige to recall a fine gravestone epitaph in his
  local churchyard. Which in turn prompts me to recall one of my own favourite epitaphs,
  that of the quack doctor Lionel Lockyer (1600-1672), whose miracle pills included
  sunbeams among their ingredients, in Southwark Cathedral:

  Here Lockyer; lies interr''d enough; his name

  Speakes one hath few competitors in fame;

  A name soe Great, soe Generall''t may scorne

  Inscriptions whch doe vulgar tombs adorne.

  A diminution ''tis to write in verse

  His eulogies whch most mens mouths rehearse.

  His virtues and his PILLS are soe well known..

  That envy can''t confine them vnder stone.

  But they''ll survive his dust and not expire

  Till all things else at th''universall fire.

  This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe

  To future times without an Epitaph
