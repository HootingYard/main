full_text: 'SCROFULA AND PENITENCE IN THE MIDDLE AGES

  Scrofula is the Latin word for brood sow, and it is the term applied to a tuberculous
  infection of the chain of lymph glands in the neck, creating swellings between the
  angle of the jaw and the top of the breastbone. It has been known to afflict people
  since antiquity, and during the Middle Ages was known as "the King''s Evil", because
  it was thought that the monarch''s touch would cure it. We may scoff at such naivete,
  especially given the rather disturbing personal habits of kings and queens past
  and present. An early scoffer was Valentine Greatrakes (1628-1666), a Cromwellian
  soldier during the English Civil War. In the revolutionary mood of the time, he
  correctly surmised that God could act through himself as well as through the royal
  personage, and did his own scrofula-healing by gently stroking his patients. He
  also applied poultices made from carrots, although it is unclear whether these were
  divinely inspired.

  Back in the Middle Ages, of course, when only the King was thought to be capable
  of curing scrofula by touch, there was also a great enthusiasm for penitence. Natural
  calamities of all kinds were thought to be the Terrible Judgment of an Angry God,
  a not unreasonable idea. Pestilence was met with penitence, rather than with carrot
  poultices, although perhaps I am oversimplifying. No doubt some canny peasants used
  both approaches.

  And what can we learn from this, o tiny ones? Well, if you think you have contracted
  scrofula, or indeed any other malady, such as Asiatic Bird Flu, a pandemic of which
  we are promised by world health officials, you would be well advised to repent your
  sins, preferably in a manner that involves the mortification of the flesh, and while
  doing so, grate some carrots.

  Next week, we shall take a look at Fundamentalist Aztec Sun-worshippers and Swamp
  Fever.


  A terrifically helpful diagram of the human skull. Remember, it''s under that jaw
  that scrofulous swellings occur.


  THE GLOVE OF IB

  Here is an accurate account of a dream I had just before I woke up this morning.

  I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion, whose identity was hazy. We
  were walking, and passed a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance, gaunt, and
  dressed in very plain, neat brown coats and hats. They had a film noir air. If they
  hadn''t been so thin Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play one or both
  of them. I turned to my companion, pointed at one of the men, and said "He just
  said ib". The man at whom I had pointed thrust out his hand, clad in a brown (leather?)
  glove and clutched me around the throat. He fixed me with a stare more intense than
  menacing, and withdrew his hand, leaving the glove in place. "That is the Glove
  of Ib," he announced, "Now read this." He handed me a pamphlet, on which was written
  "He has weak Bomba. His Bomba is not good". I understood that this referred to me.
  The words were printed in heavy black block capitals on brown paper and reminded
  me of a Vorticist tract like Wyndham Lewis'' BLAST. The Glove of Ib, around my neck,
  was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to be rid of it. The Peter Lorre figures had
  disappeared--time had passed--and I walked around the seaside resort, alone now,
  trying to find them. Then I woke up.

  What can it all mean? I should point out that I did not wake to find myself being
  strangled, nor had my neck become entangled by a stray dressing-gown cord or length
  of string. One thing of which I am sure is that I must work hard today on strengthening
  my Bomba.


  Lorre & Lewis

  ADDENDUM : Last week I had one of those dreams in which you read or write something
  of breathtaking profundity. Usually, the earth-shattering words are forgotten as
  soon as you awake, and the morning is spent in a state of frustration, trying to
  retrieve what seemed so meaningful. On this occasion, I was lucky enough to recall
  what I had dream-written, and I can thus share my dazzling insight with you. It
  was a poem, and--in its entirety--read as follows:

  We are steam, and we mean what we mean


  GLIB HATTER

  One of the stories I grew up with, that I heard a hundred times at my mother''s
  knee, was the tale of the glib hatter. When I say "at my mother''s knee" I am using
  a cliche, of course. For one thing, I did not literally squat at my mother''s knee,
  and in any case she had two knees. If I wanted you to picture me, so many years
  ago, hearing the tale of the glib hatter, and if I had squatted as indicated, I
  would have been precise, and written "at my mother''s left knee" or "at my mother''s
  right knee", not just "at my mother''s knee", unless of course she had only one
  knee, due to amputation of one of her legs above the knee, which was, happily, not
  the case. Although even if it were, it would still be proper to indicate which knee,
  the left or the right, she retained, after Old Mister Sawbones had chopped the leg
  with the other one off and put it on a pyre to be burned.

  I heard my mother tell me the tale of the glib hatter many times, but usually when
  I was tucked up in bed, under my blankets, ready for sleep. In fact, almost always,
  I drifted into sleepyland while my mother was in the middle of the story. Sometimes
  she would only get as far as the bit where the glib hatter steals a basket of potatoes
  from the ice maiden. If I was a little more alert, for example if I snuck into the
  pantry before bed and helped myself to a few glucose tablets, which I sometimes
  did, for I craved glucose as a child, and still do, I might be able to remain awake
  for as long as it took my mother to reach the point in the story where the glib
  hatter is attacked by a bison out on the savannah. But usually I was so exhausted
  from my Canadian Air Force exercises that my eyelids were drooping almost as soon
  as that dulcet voice said "Once upon a time there was a hatter, and the hatter was
  glib".

  I do want you to be able to picture me, all tucked up, listening to my bedtime story.
  It is important that you can see in your mind''s eye the blankets, the bed, the
  carpet and the curtains, the floor, ceiling and walls, the chair and chest of drawers
  and all the other things in the room, and me with my tousled mop of hair snug on
  the pillow, and my mother sat by my bedside, her hair in a bun and her smock filthy
  from cooking, one plump hand holding the book and the other plump hand holding a
  torch, its faint beam aimed at the page from which she is reading, for we had no
  electricity in the house, we relied on that one torch and many, many candles.

  I forgot to say that there would always be a dog on the floor at the foot of the
  bed. It was a mastiff called Bob. My mother insisted in later years that it was
  named after President Nixon''s disgraced, indeed imprisoned, Chief of Staff H R
  "Bob" Haldeman, but she was wrong, she was oh so wrong. The mastiff was called Bob
  for quite a different reason. It saddened me, in those later years, to argue over
  this so violently with my dear mother, after all those hours she had spent reading
  the tale of the glib hatter to me by torchlight, while I fell asleep, in my bedroom
  on the attic floor of the house on the edge of the marshes, that crumbling house
  that stood all alone surrounded by will-o-the-wisps and eerie flickering lights.

  I remember that once I managed to stay awake for the whole story. Mama began to
  read after giving me my tumbler of hot milk at around nine o'' clock. It was winter,
  so already pitch dark outside. Mercifully, the shutters were closed tight and all
  the doors had been locked and double-locked. The only sounds were the tick tock
  of the clock on my bedroom wall, the wheezing breath of Bob the mastiff at the foot
  of my bed, and, faintly and from across the marshes, far far away, the bellowing
  of Old Farmer Frack''s barnyard animals as he herded them from one field to another,
  back and forth, over and over again, for no apparent purpose. One of the first things
  I ever learned was that Old Farmer Frack was a mad old man and that if I ever came
  face to face with him I should turn and run like the wind. I don''t know why I was
  so wakeful that night, why I listened so intently as my mother reached the bit about
  the ice maiden''s potatoes, and then the bison-attack, and still I lay wide-eyed,
  lapping up every detail, new things I had never heard before, because I always dropped
  off, things like the glib hatter falling down a pothole, and eating lettuce, and
  the blind man getting his hair cut, and thousands of frogs, and the part where the
  glib hatter cheats at cards when playing whist with the widow, and the village where
  all the children wear pointy caps, and the adventure of the pit pony, and the part
  where a vaporous apparition of Ringo Starr floats over the rooftops, and the glib
  hatter gets mixed up with a lax potter, and the shrubs and firestorms and cotoneaster
  and clay and architecture and a new serum and Klondike gold and cows and crows and
  bauxite and birdseed and huge ponds filled with teardrops, millions and billions
  of teardrops in millions and billions of sad and salty ponds.

  I think it must have been about four o'' clock in the morning when my mother read
  "And that is the end of the story of the glib hatter", and she extinguished the
  torch and kissed my forehead and I shut my eyes at last and fell asleep.


  WAXY INSENSIBILITY

  Another letter arrives from Max Decharne, wit, sage, and originator of the well-known
  catchphrase "Well, tie me to a tree and call me Barry". Max writes to say that,
  in his recent reading, he learned of the now-neglected British surrealist painter
  Robin Ironside. "When he wasn''t designing the four-foot obelisk in Sevenhampton
  churchyard which commemorates Ian Fleming," writes Max, "Ironside painted pictures
  with titles that might appeal to you." They do, they do. Here are the titles of
  six paintings from the 1940s:

  Street Entertainer Playing Threatening Music To A Cinema Queue

  A Picture To Prove That The Greeks Only Painted With Three Colours

  Wounded Man In Bed-sitting Room

  Crowd Awaiting A Portent

  Famous Statues Visiting A Museum Of People

  Patients Suffering From Waxy Insensibility

  I have not been able to track down any reproductions on the web: perhaps an enthusiastic
  reader can do further research?


  SAINT MUNGO : READ AND LEARN

  A couple of days ago we noted, as we do, the feast day of Saint Mungo. You ought
  to know that Saint Mungo''s mother, Tenew, was thrown from the top of Traprain Law,
  a large hill outside Edinburgh, by her father Loth. Because she survived the plunge,
  it was thought she was a witch, so she was cast adrift in a coracle. Fetching up
  at Saint Serf''s religious establishment on Culross, she gave birth to Mungo on
  the beach. This happened in the sixth century.


  Mungo had a bell. He is a very important saint to robins. Saint Serf had a pet robin
  which was slaughtered by Mungo''s jealous classmates, who hoped to pin the blame
  on him. But Mungo restored the bird to life. Later on, he swapped his pastoral stave
  with Saint Columba.

  There is a special mass for Saint Mungo, dating from the thirteenth century, which
  has been printed by the Bollandists. The Bollandists are an association of ecclesiastical
  scholars engaged in editing the Acta Sanctorum, a great hagiographical collection
  begun during the first years of the seventeenth century, and continued to our own
  day. The work was conceived by Heribert Rosweyde (1569-1629). Under the title Fasti
  sanctorum quorum vitae in belgicis bibliothecis manuscriptiae, he gave in a little
  volume, published by the Plantin press at Antwerp, an alphabetical list of the names
  of the saints whose acts had been either found by him or called to his attention
  in old manuscript collections. This list filled fifty pages; the prefatory notice
  in which he indicates the character and arrangement of his work takes up fourteen.
  Finally, the work contains an appendix of twenty-six pages containing the unpublished
  acts of the passion of the holy Cilician martyrs, Tharsacus, Probus, and Andronicus,
  but not Mungo, who was not, in any case, a holy Cilician martyr.

  Rosweyde planned supplementary volumes which would include the authors of the lives,
  the sufferings of the martyrs, the images of the saints, liturgical rites and customs
  mentioned in hagiographical documents, profane customs to which allusions had been
  made, questions of chronology, names of places encountered in these same documents,
  barbarous or obscure terms which might puzzle the readers, and tables showing the
  names of the saints whose lives had been published in the preceding volumes, the
  same names followed by notes indicating the place of the saint''s birth, his station
  in life, his title to sanctity, the time and place in which he had lived, and the
  author of his life, the state of life of the various saints (religious, priest,
  virgin, widow, etc.), their position in the Church (apostle, bishop, abbot, etc.),
  the nomenclature of the saints according to the countries made illustrious by their
  birth, apostolate, sojourn, burial, nomenclature of the places in which they are
  honoured with a special cult, enumeration of the maladies for the cure of which
  they are especially invoked, the professions placed under their patronage, the proper
  names of persons and places encountered in the published lives, the passages of
  Holy Scripture there explained, points which may be of use in religious controversies,
  those applicable in the teaching of Christian doctrine, a general table of words
  and things in alphabetical order, "and others still," added the author, "if anything
  of importance presents itself, of which our readers may give us an idea".

  This is such an important topic that we shall return to it at a later date. Meanwhile,
  you can commit to memory the little rhyme associated with Saint Mungo:


  The tree that never grew, The bird that never flew, The fish that never swam, The
  bell that never rang.


  POPPY NISBET''S MUSIC TIPS

  Mrs Gubbins is frantically busy with her new magazine about velcro, dubbin and crayons*
  (see 26th January), so we asked Poppy Nisbet to come up with a recommended website
  for you to visit when you have exhausted the heady, exotic pleasures of Hooting
  Yard. Here''s Poppy:

  Hello readers. There''s nothing I like better than to clamp my iPod to my head and
  listen to exciting music. Being a woman of rectitude, I never download anything
  illegally, so my recommendation today comes with a stern injunction to purchase
  the delightful compact disc from which the sample tracks are taken. I just know
  you''re going to adore it. My own reaction on hearing these songs was a combination
  of glee and awe.

  I speak of that unique musician Bob Drake, whose new record, The Shunned Country,
  is packed with no less than fifty-two songs. Go and download eight of them, sit
  back, and listen carefully. You too, I have no doubt, will be as thrilled as I was.
  While you''re listening, if you can bear to stay away from Hooting Yard for a while,
  it will be worth your while to roam around Bob''s site, which contains many, many
  delights.

  *NOTE : Mrs Gubbins has just sent--by pneumatic packet--a note to say that she has
  expanded the purview of her new publication. In addition to velcro, dubbin and crayons,
  her Daily Digest will also cover string, grease, bellows, plasma gas, methods of
  divination, parcels, The Love Boat, different types of paste, hints on horticulture,
  the life-cycle of bumblebees, Spring-heeled Jack, grizzly bears, cotton, Cotton
  Mather, shampoo recipes, tungsten railings, poop deck etiquette, the Lindbergh Kidnapping
  Hoax, towels, blizzards, cocoa, genuflection, hatred, floppy things, irked Klondike
  gold prospectors, the legend of Anaxagrotax, ink, bales, crumpled things, the Burgomeisters
  of Calais, dots on a transparent plane, geese, why Jif is now called Cif, mordant
  pelicans, drums in the night, the contents of the stomach of an ostrich, the recording
  of Disraeli Gears by Cream, turquoise jewellery, goldfinches, starlings, the collected
  writings of Elkan Allan, taverns in Didcot, maps of Sumatra, tonsured friars, food
  poisoning, wooden kettles, Toc H lamps, pulverized lumps of basalt, wimples and
  snoods, Daktari, voodoo, jam, kale, strabismus, Molotov cocktails and the true meaning
  of the pendant worn by Christopher Plummer on his wedding day.


  THREE YEARS AGO

  This piece, entitled Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, appeared in Hooting Yard three
  years ago today, on 30th January 2005.

  Hark! The herald angels are singing the song of Stakhanov, the heroic worker. The
  herald angels are legion, but there are only two Stakhanovs. That''s right, two.
  One Stakhanov is busy at the forge, just like Felix Randal the farrier*, busy in
  his bellowing room, smelting iron or hammering a huge sheet of steel with implacable
  industry. The other Stakhanov is a pale aesthete. He has a bow tie, luxuriant locks,
  a thin Ronald Colman moustache, and is lounging in a buttercuppy meadow, propped
  on one immaculate elbow, reading a book of poetry. It is the collected lyrics of
  some forgotten noodling progressive rock group. What will become of the two Stakhanovs?
  Hark! Let us listen to what the herald angels are singing.

  The hero worker at his forge / The aesthete in a meadow / Lampblacked one and the
  other in serge / But both end on the gallows

  Gosh! So, according to the herald angels, both Stakhanovs will come to a sticky
  end. We must assume that they can accurately predict the future, being herald angels.
  When they had finished their song, we sent one of our reporters to interview them.
  They were not happy about this, but put forward one of their number, an angel named
  Angerecton, to act as their spokesangel.

  Now you and I know that Angerecton is a fumigating angel rather than a true herald
  angel, so it should be no surprise that the interview was unsatisfactory. In any
  event, our reporter found that his tape recorder malfunctioned, and all he could
  hear when he played back the tape was the sound of mighty and glorious angelic hosannahs,
  not unlike Spem In Alium by Thomas Tallis. As Dobson once wrote, in another context,
  "Angels sing, and devils make a din, but the heroic worker pounds his hammer and
  the poet praises Stalin". I think that before too long, you and I and both Stakhanovs
  will be deafened by the devil''s din.

  * O is he dead then?'
