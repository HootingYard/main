full_text: 'RAILWAY FORECAST

  Readers in the UK will know that the Met Office Shipping Forecast, broadcast on
  BBC radio four times a day to an audience composed mainly of landlubbers ignorant
  of its meaning, is one of our national treasures. Overseas readers who have no idea
  what I am talking about can read a splendidly detailed entry in the Wikipedia.

  A great part of the charm, of course, is those wonderful names--Cromarty, Dogger,
  German Bight--and the other day it struck me that an equally delightful list is
  to be found in the stations on the Docklands Light Railway in London. Here, then,
  is today''s DLR Forecast.

  HENDIADYS IN MUDCHUTE


  And further, let it be known, known and digested, known and digested and regurgitated,
  regurgitated in the form of words, that it be known better, that in the last century
  Mudchute was the home of a monomaniac. Actually, to call Caspian Sea Spanglebag
  a monomaniac is not strictly true, for he had not one but two abiding obsessions.

  The first, which is of little interest to us, was his conviction that the tyrant
  of the Soviet Union was called Josef Starling, while the heroine of Thomas Harris''
  The Silence Of The Lambs was named Clarice Stalin. Being bonkers, Spanglebag was
  unmoved by the facts that the moustachioed and heavily pockmarked dictator chose
  the pseudonym "Man of Steel" in preference to his real name of Djugashvili, and
  that the troubled FBI rookie is a fictional character.

  But it was the Mudchute man''s belief that hendiadys is a disease afflicting poultry,
  rather than a figure of speech, which consumed most of his energies. It would not
  be an exaggeration to say that Spanglebag declared war on the makers of dictionaries,
  lexicons, grammars and encyclopaedias. Most of the major publishers of reference
  books have somewhere in their archives a fat file containing letters with that Mudchute
  postmark, all written by pencil in tiny, tiny handwriting, their tone varying from
  mild complaint to violent menace. One example will suffice.

  I purchased the latest edition of your wordbook, writes Spanglebag on 23rd June
  1989, and was surprised to see you define hendiadys as "a figure of speech in which
  two words connected by a conjunction are used to express a single notion that would
  normally be expressed by an adjective and a substantive; the use of two conjoined
  nouns instead of a noun and modifier". You then go on to list instances from the
  Bible, such as "a mouth and wisdom" in Luke 21:15, and "the hope and resurrection
  of the dead" in Acts 23:6. I do not take kindly to spending money on such drivel,
  and have torn your worthless book to shreds, and I would have scattered those shreds
  to the winds from atop a hill, were there any high hills in Mudchute, which there
  are not, so instead I steeped the shreds in buckets of water until they were but
  pulp, yes! pulp. Please correct your gruesome error in future editions, or I will
  ensure you become the laughing stocks of the reference book world, and you will
  weep with shame.

  Note that Spanglebag sees no reason to advance his own belief that hendiadys has
  something to do with sick poultry. To him, it would have been to point out the obvious,
  like saying that water is wet, that the Pope is Catholic, or that Hooting Yard is
  by far the loveliest thing on the wuh-wuh-wuh, and not just by far, but far and
  away, away with the fairies, tiny delicate shimmering beings with wings, which,
  if they exist, exist only in Cottingley, where they are made of paper, and held
  in place in the garden by means of pins.

  How pertinent is the fact that this odd little man, Spanglebag, lived his whole
  life in Mudchute, only rarely roaming farther afield? I think it is crucial. It
  made him what he was, even before the construction of the Docklands Light Railway.
  It is as if he embodied the spirit of the place, Mudchute''s mud and Mudchute''s
  chute, the caked, black, stinking mud and the gleaming metal chute down which it
  slides and slithers and tumbles, into god knows what foul pit of hideousness and
  eeuurrgghh.

  2005. Can it really be so long ago? Yes, it can. It is.]


  FAN FICTION FAD

  The fad for fan fiction shows no sign of abating. The internet is riddled with websites
  where adherents of, say, Harry Potter or The West Wing or Star Wars pen their own
  tales about existing fictional creations. That most of the sources are from films
  and television, rather than books, is I suppose a sign of the times, but at least
  these keyboard-tapping enthusiasts are writing. I was pleased to note the other
  day that Hooting Yard has attracted its own fan fiction. Here is a brief story I
  found about Dobson, written by a certain R Hanrahan:


  An old hotel in Winnipeg

  Once upon a time there was a man called Dobson. He was a pamphleteer and all his
  pamphlets were out of print. At the time of which I write, Dobson lived in a shack
  perched on a promontory, from where he could see in the far distance a lighthouse.
  The incessant flashing of the lights atop the lighthouse disturbed Dobson in the
  night, for his bedroom was on the side of the shack facing out to sea, and he could
  not afford curtains. In the town down the hill there was a curtain shop, and one
  day after yet another virtually sleepless night, Dobson went to the shop and asked
  if they had any curtains for rental.

  "We don''t rent out our curtains," said the proprietor of the curtain shop, curtly.
  Dobson was disappointed. He left the curtain shop and went across the road to the
  recently-opened clinic of the brain doctor.

  "Excuse me," said Dobson to the receptionist. His tone was icily calm. "Would it
  be possible for the brain doctor to align the electrical pulsing of my brain with
  the rhythm of the flashing lights of the lighthouse over yonder?"

  "Yes," said the receptionist, gaily.

  So the brain doctor tweaked Dobson''s brain that very afternoon.

  "Because you are an out-of-print pamphleteer, you don''t have to pay," said the
  receptionist as Dobson left the clinic. He marched up the hill to his shack, looking
  forward to a good night''s sleep at last. He was disconcerted, then, to discover
  that another shack had been erected on the promontory, slap bang next to his, and
  that it was already occupied by a group of pagan percussionists whose rituals demanded
  that they pound their drums throughout the night to ward off something or other.
  Dobson was downcast until he discovered that, miraculously, the rhythms of the lighthouse
  lights, his pulsing brain, and the drumming were identical.

  He slept well that night, and every night he spent in the shack on the promontory
  thereafter, until the following year, when he moved to a hotel in Winnipeg.


  ON GODS

  Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. These are gods. They are not toys or trinkets, plastic
  figurines or dolls made out of scraps of wool or straw. They are gods. Maat. Aten.
  Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. These too are gods. Mighty, imperious gods. Geb is the Great
  Cackler, Hapi the Father of the Gods, Anubis the Jackal, Khnum the Lord of the Cool
  Waters, Ra the Sun God, Maat the Goddess of Truth, Aten the Lord of All, Sekhmet
  the Mighty One, Hathor the Mistress of Heaven and Horus He Who Is Above. Bow down
  before them for they are powerful deities. While you cower in your ditch, grovelling,
  they bestride the heavens. Not toys, I say, but gods. Ammut. Isis. Bastet. Nut.
  Ptah. The devourer, the throne, the tearer, the sky, the opener. Above you the sky
  is black and fat with stars, for it is night, illimitable and desolate, and you
  are an uncomprehending mite alone on a burning planet, sprawling in your ditch.
  They are gods. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. Big, towering, potent gods
  and goddesses. Aker the Double Lion God. Khepri He who comes into existence. Sobek
  He who causes fertility. Taurt the Great Lady. Seshat, ah Seshat, the Lady of the
  Library, and Seth the Lord of Upper Egypt. These are the gods. You are not in Upper
  Egypt, nor in Lower Egypt. You are not in Egypt at all. But wherever your ditch
  is, in this night as hard as iron, you abase yourself before these gods, because
  you must. The time for toys and trinkets, for the bauble and the gewgaw, is long
  past, and you have left all fripperies behind you. Now there is simply you and your
  gods, locked together, in the face of the stark blank sky. Min. Mut. Osiris. Amun.
  Nephthys. Neith. The Chief of Heaven, the Lady of Heaven, the King of the Dead,
  the Hidden One, the Lady of the House and the Great Goddess. Bow down, bow down.
  You have a forelock. It is there to be tugged, so tug it. Tug it in obeisance to
  Thoth, the Great Measurer. And to Ra, to Ra, to Ra!

  Now plant your brow in the muck on the floor of the ditch and cast your mind back
  to that golden happy childhood when you plashed in the paddling pool on a sun-blazed
  summer''s day. The water was cool and delightful, the water in your paddling pool.
  Did you rush home wrapped in your big yellow towel and worship Khnum? Did you thank
  Khnum for the coolness of the water? Dried and cooled, did you clutch your library
  ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library to
  borrow a book of fairy stories? You would have looked for something with pictures
  of elves and wizards and peris and hobgoblins, and found a compendium, perhaps,
  carried it on tippytoe to the issuing desk bathed in the glorious sunshine streaming
  through those enormous library windows, had it stamped, and borne your borrowed
  book away, out onto the path in the bright afternoon. When you got home, safe in
  your bedroom strewn with pillows and cushions and patchwork quilts and throws, did
  you cry out in gratitude to Seshat?

  Mut. Nut. Horus. Seth. Anubis. These are gods. All-powerful and eternal. I can picture
  you, a few summers later, older but no wiser, traipsing around in the park at lunchtime.
  You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grass as food
  for sparrows and magpies and starlings, for linnets and ravens, for bufflehead ducks
  and grebes. Sitting on the rusty bench with its rusty plaque in memory of one long
  dead who sat here often and adored the view, the view of rooftops and chimneys and
  football fields and allotments, of tennis courts and orchards rich in cherry trees,
  I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and I know that you are not giving thanks
  to Aten or Geb or Sekhmet or Ptah. No. Still at this time, despite your riches and
  your bravura, your poor head is filled with visions of Itzpapalotl, Coatlicue, Temazcalteci,
  Tlaloc, Mayahual, Cihuateto, Huixtocihuatl, Popocatepetl and the like, for these
  are your gods. In the grip of your delusions, it is perhaps not coincidental that
  you like to sport a yellow polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee
  in The Wicker Man, and even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you are
  not yet going grey, and you insist that you have not seen the film, for you profess
  a devotion to the silent screen. In your pantheon, Abel Gance rubs shoulders with
  Oxomoco, Lilian Gish with Quetzalcoatl. You have seen Broken Blossoms more than
  a dozen times, and sometimes you like to pace the back streets of Limehouse as if
  in search of the opium dens that are no longer there, the dens from which Sherlock
  Holmes emerged twitching and shattered in The Man With The Twisted Lip. Those fog-enshrouded
  days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth, yet you
  cling to your false gods as you feed the birds and ducks in the park, shaded from
  Nut''s glittering sky by the overhanging branches of sycamores and hazel trees,
  on the bench by the magnificent iron railings which were replaced after the war
  in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach, burned by flaming
  barrels, and crushed by falling masonry, but now there is not a scratch on you,
  and you have forgotten that terrible day in Scheveningen. You were treated well
  in the field hospital, but what did you do, once you could again use your hands?
  You scavenged scraps of wood and built a little toy altar and put it on your bedside
  shelf, praying to Ixtlilton, your god of healing, for having saved you from the
  realm of Mictlantecuhtle.

  So let us spring forward again now, another ten, twenty years, and now your hair
  is grey, but no longer cut a la Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man. Your yellow polo
  neck is threadbare now, and you use it as a dust-cloth. There is much dust in your
  home, for the air is never still there. Draughts curl in under the doors and around
  the window frames, for much of the wood is rotting away under sustained attack by
  weevils and woodworms, microscopic forms of life you have ignored for too long.
  Baleful, greasy, plump, a little cracked, you shuffle from room to room, pointlessly,
  as if you have been kennelled. All your money is gone, exhausted by your postwar
  debaucheries. You have a blighted reputation and constant pins and needles. That
  is what accounts for your restlessness, this shuffling from bedroom to pantry to
  parlour to outhouse, from attic to cellar, and back again, up and down and round
  and round and always with your liver-spotted fist clamped around a little tin medallion
  of Montezuma as if that might fend off the night, the darkness, the vastness of
  eternity. You have a kitten, but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated
  by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten Karen Carpenter
  and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds, or with eels you thieve from the
  back-kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses at you and claws you and loathes
  the sight of you. You are fearful of the light in those green eyes, for you rightly
  sense that they see into your soul, your small and puny soul, all curdled by a life
  of waste and delusion that Centeotl would bring you corn, that Chantico would warm
  your hearth, that the wind cried Ehecatl. The gods are in readiness for you and
  the wind is cold.

  Yes, it is night now, and you are in your ditch. The wind is cold and the sky is
  black and there are no birds, not even crows. Your kitten tore that pitiful tin
  medallion from your hand and dropped it down a well. You are alone, but for the
  gods. Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. You have sunk to your knees. That blurred black
  and white image of Lilian Gish, stricken by panic in The Wind, is fading fast. Like
  Sherlock Holmes, you too are twitching and shattered, but no opiates brought you
  to this. Maat. Aten. Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. There is no longer any traffic, no
  car horns, no rattling carts, no clanking steamer plying across the strait. Despite
  your wealth, you never did fly in an aeroplane across oceans and continents. You
  never did go and live in that house on stilts that you pictured in your mind''s
  eye when you were young. Parks and ponds were your domain, parks and ponds. And
  now this ditch, a trickle of foul brackish water running through it. You cup some
  in your hands and splash it on your burning brow but it is not the cool water from
  the paddling pool given to you by Khnum all those years ago. Ammut. Isis. Bastet.
  Nut. Ptah. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. There came that day, that Thursday,
  when your nerves were so brittle and the pins and needles became too much, and you
  flung your Montezuma medallion across the pantry and cursed your gods, and the kitten
  crept up to you and fixed its green eyes on you. You retrieved your tin gewgaw and
  fled to the park to watch the grebes, but you were shaken. You have not been still
  since then, you are like the gusts of air swirling around your house, the house
  you lived in then. Min. Mut. Osiris. Amun. Nephthys. Neith. These are the gods.
  And Ra. And Anubis. And Thoth, the Great Measurer, Thoth who is ready to take your
  measure now. Be still. Be measured. Be still.


  LAST NIGHT''S DREAM

  Accounts of dreams are rarely of interest to anyone other than the dreamer. We awake,
  sometimes, with fugitive memories of wonder and amazement and unutterable strangeness,
  which, when put into cold print, lose all their lustre and seem barely more intriguing
  than our mundane lives. So I have not deemed any of my slumberland visions worthy
  of inclusion here since that exciting dream related on 27th January this year under
  the title The Glove Of Ib.

  Last night I had one of those seemingly endless, episodic dreams which flitted from
  one scene to another with remorseless unreason. One part stayed with me after I
  woke, and, despite the above, I think it may be of interest to Hooting Yard readers.

  I was giving a talk in a huge auditorium to an audience of youngsters. They were
  gathered at one end of the hall, and I was in the middle. Immediately behind me
  was a sort of hardboard screen, beyond which was the "workshop" wherein my two assistants
  were located. One of these assistants was the late actor Roy Kinnear. He was sat
  at a table on which was a record turntable, and he kept playing snatches of an LP
  of classical music--piano and cello, I recall. I wished for silence while addressing
  the youths, and kept ducking back behind the screen asking Mr Kinnear to stop playing
  the record, but every time I returned to my lectern, the music started up again.
  Eventually, I grabbed a wooden chair leg and ran at Roy Kinnear, brandishing it
  above my head and threatening to bash his head in if he did not cease.


  Roy Kinnear

  That''s it. Then the dream went off at a tangent I forget. I haven''t thought about
  Roy Kinnear for years. Sadly, he died in 1988, on horseback, while filming in Spain.
  I would like to offer him a posthumous apology, and assure his ghost that he can
  play snatches of cello and piano music for all eternity, without the threat of being
  clubbed with a chair leg.


  CEMETERY BIRDS

  In Tantarabim, the lopwit is known as the Cemetery Bird. By law, all graveyards
  in that land are situated at the seaside, so one might expect gulls or guillemots
  or other seabirds to be most associated with the tombstones. Yet it is the lopwit,
  small, tufted, brightly-coloured, that is invoked in the funeral practices of the
  people of Tantarabim. Why?

  As so often, we can turn to the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson to help us answer
  this question. It is true that, throughout his copious writings, he never addressed
  the subject directly. True, too, that his knowledge of ornithology was paltry and
  lamentable, and more often than not wholly inaccurate. With Dobson, it is a case
  of knowing where to look. We will not find a pamphlet called Why They Call The Lopwit
  The Cemetery Bird In Tantarabim, but now, with the long overdue publication of Aloysius
  Nestingbird''s Mighty Concordance Dobsoniana, we know that the answer to the question
  can be pieced together from a number of sources. There is that impertinent little
  footnote in An Essay About Bowls, Dishes And Pots. There is a majestic, sweeping
  paragraph in A Pamphlet Of Majestic Sweeping Paragraphs. There is a ham-fisted pencil
  drawing in the appendix to Why I Smashed My Copy Of "Thick As A Brick" By Jethro
  Tull Into Twenty Thousand Pieces With A Geological Hammer And Then Glued It Back
  Together Again. And, of course, there are the famous lines hidden away in Dobson''s
  so-called Uberpamphlet, in which he writes:

  "Lopwits flock to the seaside cemeteries of Tantarabim in search of spurge and sukebind.
  They munch these plants greedily, if one can use the word munch to describe the
  way they tear savagely at the foliage with their beaks and swallow each beakful
  whole, having no teeth, for I can now reveal that, in common with other birds, lopwits
  are innocent of teeth. Would that I could say the same of myself."

  Commentators have long been amused at Dobson''s presumption in claiming to be the
  first person in history to point out that birds do not have teeth. Less remarked
  is the fact that he is completely wrong about the lopwits'' diet. These birds--which
  are small, tufted, and brightly-coloured, as we have seen--eat neither spurge nor
  sukebind. If they did so, they would surely die of poisoning, for they do not produce
  the enzymes necessary to break down and digest these particular plants. You can
  look that up in the most basic encyclopaedia of avian digestive systems. Who knows
  why Dobson could not be bothered to do so?


  The propellers on the aeroplanes in the airfield across the road are making a terrible
  racket and I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I think I will cram some cotton
  wool into my ears.


  Dobson would often bang on about his devotion to research. It made him something
  of a trying companion, for it was not beyond him to regale a tavern''s worth of
  peasants with a harangue. "Do you people realise," he might shout, apropos of nothing,
  "That before writing my pamphlet entitled Notes On A Shelf Of Test Tubes Containing
  The Blood Of Squirrels I read fourteen different encyclopaedias from cover to cover,
  together with the collected works of Emily Dickinson, T Lobsang Rampa, and Harold
  Pinter?" Of course, in remarks such as these--which have been reported to us by
  Marigold Chew and others--Dobson unwittingly makes clear that his understanding
  of "research" is, to put it kindly, somewhat witless. If he genuinely intended to
  say anything meaningful about the blood of squirrels, what perverse impulse would
  make him think he could find any useful material in, say, the works of a grumpy
  bespectacled north London misanthrope? And yet this was always the way he worked,
  with his magpie mind, to the despair of some and the delight of others. That is
  why this new Concordance will prove such a boon to scholars. If you want to know
  what Dobson had to say about the cemetery birds of Tantarabim, there is no point
  looking in any of the eighty-nine pamphlets which mention birds in the title, nor
  in either of the two monographs on Tantarabim-related topics which Dobson wrote
  while holed up in that milk of magnesia warehouse in Winnipeg. Similarly, should
  you want to discover what the great pamphleteer had to say about obsolete punctuation
  marks, it may come as some surprise to find that there are at least twenty pages
  of pertinent remarks in the virtually forgotten early pamphlet Observations On Cows
  From A Great Distance, In The Rain.

  Speaking of cows, it is worth mentioning here that in addition to the seaside cemeteries
  with their allotted lopwits, there was, in old Tantarabim, a single inland cemetery,
  far from the sea, known as the Graveyard of Cows. On this occasion we need not consult
  Dobson, for the story is well known. Cows grazed in the Graveyard of Cows, to keep
  down the grass, and when they died, the same cows were buried there. The mezzotintist
  and amateur historian of Tantarabim, Rex Tint, unearthed a mezzotint which showed
  the big signboard which stood at the graveyard gates, and translated the notice
  engraved thereon:

  "Hey there, passer-by in the day or night, stop now! Rest your weary legs and know
  that ye stand at the gates of the Graveyard of Cows. This plot of land was given
  in perpetuity to cows alive and cows dead by order of the Grand Plenipotentiary
  Vizier of Old Tantarabim according to visions which beset him as he knelt in his
  hanging gardens pruning his laburnums. No laburnums must grow in the grounds of
  the Graveyard of Cows, nor cinquefoil, nor rhubarb, nor lupins. Nay, thou shalt
  find in this field only towering hollyhocks among the grass, and cows feeding upon
  the grass, and the cows shall feed upon the grass among the hollyhocks of these
  fields until such time as they perish. And each time a graveyard cow leaves this
  mortal world, six villagers shall come unto here and use big spades to dig for that
  cow a grave beneath the grass. Two villagers shall be named Ned. Two shall be blind.
  One shall wear the hat of Boohoocha. And one shall be a puny person. And they shall
  dig the grave for the cow in the night time, under a black and starless sky, and
  bury the cow by morning. Now move on, traveller, wherever you are bound, but remember
  always the cows of Tantarabim as long as you ever shall live."'
