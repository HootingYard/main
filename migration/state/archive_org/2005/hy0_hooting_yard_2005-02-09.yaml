  Here are four stories, each of a hundred words. Earlier versions, a little shorter
  or longer, can be dug out from the archives should you care to look.

  I

  I was sitting on a bench in a bower on a bright summer''s day. It was a Wednesday,
  or possibly a Thursday, in August, in the year after the Kennedy assassination,
  far far away in Dallas, and the air was heady with verbena, and hollyhock. I was
  eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial
  hideousness began oozing from my marmalade and fish-head sandwich, and I swooned.
  When I came to, I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained
  unaware of it for the rest of my sordid and sorry life.

  II

  They called him Blomqvist, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above
  the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day Blomqvist
  died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no doubt
  that he was dead, for hovering above his chest was a baleful phantom, emitting gruesome
  suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial hideousness which it poured into
  a funnel inserted into Blomqvist''s right ear. They closed up the room and nailed
  the door shut. It remained unopened for the next hundred years.

  III

  The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis,
  the bird scientist.

  "Look, there is a bird on the bell tower," he said to his pneumonia-racked assistant
  Cubbit, who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips.

  Jarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look, but the spindly youth was
  distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with pots and pans. It was the
  neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds, and spookily, sitting next to him in the
  passenger seat, was a hideous extraterrestrial being, suppurating, greasy and malevolent.

  IV

  "Hand me that chaffinch, Cubbit," said Jarvis to his lantern-jawed assistant. Jarvis
  was a bird scientist, devoted to the study of chaffinches. Wandering the hills,
  he had spotted one. As Cubbit picked up the chaffinch, he heard a scream. Spinning
  round, he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a gruesome suppurating monster. The poor
  lad scampered back to the lab and told what had happened to Mrs Purgative.

  "Well! I never heard of such a thing!" she exclaimed. She hoisted her mop on her
  shoulder, took Cubbit by his withered hand, and led him far away, all the way to
  Gondwanaland.


  MORE ABOUT MY BOMBA

  Readers will recall that last week I had a dream in which it was imputed--by a Peter
  Lorre lookalike--that I had weak Bomba and that my Bomba was not good (see 27th
  January). I have been puzzling over what this might mean, and what I might do to
  attain good strong Bomba. Now Pansy Cradledew has provided a possible solution to
  the mystery.

  Dear Mr Key, she writes, By remarkable coincidence, on the very day that you addressed
  your weak Bomba, I was doing some internet research on bees, as I often do when
  I find myself at a loose end. From the excellent pages maintained by Hania and Hans*,
  I learned that bumblebees are of the genus Bombus! In case you are wondering, bumblebees
  are big and extremely hairy bees. A few species of bumblebees are being bred nowadays
  to take care of pollination in greenhouses. They turn out to be very useful in growing
  tomatoes and cucumbers. One can buy colonies in specialized shops and on the internet.
  When flying most bumblebees are producing lots of noise, attracting our attention
  that way. They belong to the most beloved of all insects, for they are the perfect
  messengers announcing spring is on the way. Bumblebees have typical warning colours:
  black and yellow or black and red. And it is true: all species are capable of stinging.
  But they are not very willing to do so. We can even take many species in our hand.
  As long as we don''t squeeze them, they won''t sting us at all! Only bumblebees
  laying on their back should never be touched, for this is their typical defence
  position, indicating they feel threatened and are ready to sting! The poison they
  inject is harmless, except for those allergic to wasp poison. ( If you are not sure,
  arrange to have yourself stung by a wasp while a team of experts in insect toxicity
  stand at the ready, with bleepers.) Bumblebees are typical insects of moderate climate
  zones, with a few species even surviving arctic conditions. You won''t find them
  in the tropics though. The hairs on the body ensure they don''t cool off too soon.
  But there is more. Just like mammals bumblebees control their own body temperature.
  They can detach the muscles used to move their wings. And by moving the detached
  muscles rapidly they produce their own body heat. This is the reason you can sometimes
  find a motionless bumblebee on the ground or a flower. It is not dying or sick--it
  does not, as you would say in your dream, "have weak Bomba" -- but is simply heating
  up its own body. But due to the fact that the wings are detached from their muscles
  it is not capable of flying at the time. Bumblebees keep a body temperature of 34
  to 38 Centigrade. Oh, and just to make sure you know what I''m talking about, this
  is what they look like:


  Anyway, it seems clear to me that your dream about Bomba was a dream about two or
  more Bombuses. There is something bubbling away in your subconscious that makes
  you preoccupied with weak and "not good" -- ill? evil?--bumblebees. I suggest, Mr
  Key, that you search your soul with rigour. Did you perhaps once stamp on a little
  Bombus? Yours astutely, Pansy Cradledew

  *NOTE : Hania and Hans are seeking help in identifying unidentified wasps. Can you
  help? Please do what you can by clicking on the picture of the Bombus.


  "THERE WAS AN INTERESTING COMMUNICATION AT, OF..."

  "There was an interesting communication at, of all places, Salisbury railway station
  in 1966. I was advised by communications to build a copper cone to help my condition.
  Having read of the apparent Atlantean cones in Other Tongues, Other Flesh by George
  Hunt Williamson, with their complicated circuits, I felt unqualified to build one.
  The answer rapped back: ''Just build a simple cone of copper--that''s not beyond
  you is it?'' I sat up with a start--surely space people would not talk like that?
  But it jerked me out of my self-pity and I began a regular daily use of a cone which
  my father made from a piece of scrap sheet copper." -- Jimmy Goddard, Cosmic Friends


  NORWEGIAN WOOL

  Remember MacTavish, the village wrestler whose ugly death was described in the second
  of those Tales Of The Uncanny? If you don''t remember, go down to Friday 4th February
  and read it. Notice how it begins "They called him MacTavish". They did indeed call
  him MacTavish, but MacTavish was not his name. His name was Chris De Burhg (sic)
  and as well as being the village wrestler he was the village knitsman.

  The village had had a knitsman ever since the invention of true knitting, which
  is to say around 1100 AD, if we accept that the first historical example of knitting
  as we know it today, as opposed to other kinds of textile work, is a pair of patterned
  cotton socks found in Egypt. This is not the place to investigate how the craft
  travelled from the Nile delta, via the English clergyman William Lee''s knitting
  machine of 1589, to the godforsaken rustic silage depot where Chris De Burhg lived
  all those centuries later.

  There was a village knitswoman too, but by a curious tradition it was forbidden
  for the two ever to meet. Because it was a very small village, extraordinary precautions
  were taken, involving fences, barricades, false walls, lanes blocked by herds of
  restless barnyard animals, clocks wound misleadingly, undelivered telegrams, pits
  dug and camouflaged, and in extremis eldritch tampering with the continuum. By that
  I mean of course the space-time continuum, but I was trying to save my words as
  carefully as Chris De Burhg saved his wool.

  The village knitsman always used Norwegian wool, although the village was not a
  Norwegian one. Happy as I would be to report that it was in Finland, near the Karelian
  holiday resort of Bomba, I have to admit that it was not even in Scandinavia. Be
  that as it may.

  Chris De Burhg was careful with his wool. He was also careful with his food, for
  poisoning was rife in this village. There had been many problems with ergot before
  the war, and afterwards, and there were many sociopaths at large. Fortunately, they
  were easily identified because by decree they were all made to wear chaps, spats,
  and boxy jackets, and to live in a purple tent near a clump of gasworks. Careful
  with wool, and careful with food, Chris De Burhg, or MacTavish as they called him,
  was nevertheless a sitting duck when attacked by a ghoul with a funnel.


  CLAUDE

  Serpentine Claude had been in a gale. I asked him what sort of gale it was. I''ve
  got a lot of time for Serpentine Claude. Howling, he said. My my, a howling gale,
  was the nubbin of my reply. Was there a snap? Claude, who is a plutocrat with a
  thing about Mary Pickford, said there was a snap, and it was cold. I was beginning
  to picture Serpentine Claude in a howling gale during a cold snap, but I was hungry
  for further details. Claude misinterpreted my expression and handed me a pie. He
  is serpentine but generous, as well as plutocratic. It was a very tasty pie, and
  I ate it at once. It was a puff pastry pie with a filling of filberts and beeborage.
  While I chewed, Claude told me that the gale during the snap was accompanied by
  rain. I did not want to speak with my mouth full of pie, and before I could ask
  Claude to describe the nature of the rain, he rushed away, along that old canal
  towpath hectic with foxgloves, to a festival of Mary Pickford films being shown
  at the ship-shaped cinema in Tantarabim.

  I swallowed the last of the pie, hoisted my binoculars, and took careful note of
  a swallow perched on the bough of a sycamore over to the west. Or it may have been
  a finch. I am always getting them mixed up, ever since the railway accident. I had
  a psychic premonition of it, just like the hundreds of people who foresaw in their
  dreams the sinking of the Titanic in April 1912. There is a good book by George
  Behe which catalogues them. One day I may find out if anyone else shared my premonition
  of the railway accident and I, too, might collect them into a book.

  Years later I received a letter from Serpentine Claude. This is what he wrote:

  Dear Istvan, It has long been on my conscience, through all the years that I ensnared
  the world in my plutocratic web, that I may have mistaken your look of fixated curiosity
  about the gale during the snap for one of simple hunger. That is why I gave you
  the last of my puff pastry filbert and beeborage pies. But I was wrong, wasn''t
  I? I think I knew I was wrong within minutes of stalking off along that foxglove-strewn
  towpath, but to my shame I did not turn back to rectify my error. I was so hot for
  Mary Pickford that I gave you nary another thought. Please accept my apologies,
  and let me at long last tell you what your heart has burned to know through all
  the succeeding years, through the reigns on earth of a fair few Pontiffs. In the
  howling gale during the cold snap, the rain was torrential. It fell in torrents.
  Yours faithfully, Serpentine Claude.


  SO YOU WANT TO BECOME A HARUSPEX?

  If you are interested in becoming a haruspex, the first thing to do is choose a
  sacrificial victim and slaughter it, or, if you are squeamish, have it slaughtered
  for you. It might be a duck or a hen or a hare, and if you are having delusions
  of grandeur, you can always use a larger animal like a performing seal or a giraffe.
  Haruspices tend not to engage in human sacrifice, and it is well not to give the
  police any pretext to investigate your doings. In current law, there is no plea
  of haruspexdom to defend you against a murder rap. Remember that, it''s important.

  Now, once the victim has been slain, it is your job to interpret the entrails. You
  will be following in a long tradition. Back in Ancient Etruscan times, the earliest
  haruspices learned their art from Tages, a being who suddenly sprang from the ground
  near Tarquinii. Tages always claimed to be the grandson of Jupiter, and as no one
  ever challenged him on this, it must have been so.

  I know what you''re going to ask. Victim killed, check. Splattered with gore, check.
  Disposition of entrails visible, check. But how to interpret them? Well, that''s
  where your local library comes in. Early haruspices, sometimes known as extispices,
  wrote a series of instructional manuals called libri haruspicini, fulgurales, and
  tonitruales, and copies should be available if you ask the librarian in a very quiet
  voice, making sure you maintain eye contact. Bear in mind that municipal librarians
  become rightly suspicious of shifty-eyed borrowers, and if that means fixing them
  with a stare of unhinged madcappery, so be it. These ancient tomes are not forbidden,
  as far as I know, and you have every right to borrow them, unless you owe outstanding
  fines.

  I should have told you to get copies of the haruspicina manuals before slaughtering
  your eel, or bat, or whatever creature you selected. Sorry. Anyway, by consulting
  the books you will be well placed to interpret from the fresh entrails the will
  of the gods. And that''s all there is to it!

  If you are vegetarian or vegan, you can still qualify as a haruspex by eschewing
  entrails and instead interpreting portenta, that is lightning, earthquakes, and
  all extraordinary phenomena in nature.

  Unlike those snotty-nosed augurs, with their professional association, haruspices
  tend to be self-employed. You can drum up business by advertising in the Yellow
  Pages or placing a notice in your newsagent''s or post office''s window. Good luck!

  course and I now employ eight people and take three Etruscan holidays a year!"


  JARVIS AND CUBBIT

  One of yesterday''s three Tales Of The Uncanny featured Jarvis and Cubbit, the bird
  scientist and his assistant. Dobson filled dozens of notebooks with stories about
  these characters, whom he conceived as an immortal duo as archetypal as Don Quixote
  and Sancho Panza, Holmes and Watson, or Laurel and Hardy. Alas, the out-of-print
  pamphleteer had no talent for fiction, and the surviving manuscripts are fragmentary,
  littered with vague sketches, false starts, and incomprehensible jottings. Jim Pond,
  newly-appointed Professor of Dobson Studies at the University of Jim Pond & His
  Immediate Family, has spent countless hours in the archives to prepare a selection
  of Jarvis and Cubbit stories, and has kindly offered us permission to publish the
  following, undated, piece.

  The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis,
  the bird scientist.

  "Look, you young tyke, there is a bird on the bell tower," he said to his pneumonia-racked
  assistant Cubbit, who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips.

  Jarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look, but the spindly youth was
  distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with pots and pans. It was the
  neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds.

  Jarvis hated the Windy Man, for his clattering pots and pans made a din that often
  frightened birds, so that they flew away into the blue majestic skies just as the
  ornithologist was creeping close with his tweezers and bird beaker. The Windy Man,
  on the other hand, was passionately in love with Jarvis, and had been ever since
  he had seen the bird scientist standing on a dais making a bird-related proclamation,
  years ago, for all the world like an Apollonian god, or so he seemed to the Windy
  Man. But the Windy Man was shy, and dared not speak of his love, so he pined and
  felt pangs and was in torment.

  Cubbit knew nothing of what is related in that paragraph.

  By chance, a snapshot exists of this precise moment. It was taken by a passing camera
  buff whose fancy had been taken by a pirouetting mechanical nougat-vending machine,
  all pink and gleaming. There it is to the left in the black-and-white photograph,
  in front of the bell tower. To the right, in the foreground, we see the back of
  Cubbit''s head, next to a furious-looking Jarvis. Partially obscured behind them
  is the Windy Man''s pantechnicon, on which some of the clattering pots and pans
  are visible. Sadly, the Windy Man''s face is blurred by a smudge or a cloud of gnats
  or a freakish effulgence of mist and gas. It could be any of those things. In framing
  his photo, the enthusiast did not include the upper part of the bell tower, so we
  do not know what kind of bird Jarvis was pointing at, nor whether it was a bird
  at all, or just a fluttering black napkin borne aloft on a gentle summer breeze,
  given avian form through the power of Jarvis'' unquenchable imagination.

  Ever after, he insisted it was a trumpeter swan.
