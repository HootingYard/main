full_text: 'HORSE BEGONE

  I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still.

  "Da doo ron ron, horse begone!" she cried. It was an incantation, in a field, and
  sure enough, the horse to whom she addressed these words turned and cantered away,
  until it could no longer be seen in the mist and the drizzle.

  Somebody told me that her name was Jill, but before I could ask her, she was casting
  her spells again.

  "Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!" she yelled, at a cow, but this time without the
  desired effect. The cow just stared back at her, chewing its cud, the way cows do.

  "Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!" she repeated, a little desperately, I thought.
  If I''d been the cow, I would have sensed a moment of panic, of confidence drained.
  Jill--if Jill was her name--repeated her incantation too soon. The cow did not move.

  So I took the opportunity to stride purposefully across the field in my creaking
  black boots until I was face to face with her.

  "Somebody told me that your name is Jill," I said, essaying a bow as if I were some
  sort of Regency fop.

  "My name is not Jill," she hissed, "I am the Woohoohoodiwoodadooronron Woman. Fop
  begone!" and I found myself propelled by some eldritch force into a weird netherworld
  where I languish to this day, my only companion the horse. There is no sign of the
  cow.


  ON TADEUSZ KAPISKO AND HIS EARS OF WHEAT

  [The following piece, one of my own favourites, first appeared in Hooting Yard in
  September 2005. I find myself somewhat alarmed to think that is almost seven years
  ago. Where, where does the time go? Seven years is the length of time the Jesuits
  need to claim a child''s soul for life. It is longer than the Second World War.
  Ay de mi! Ay de mi!, as Carlyle would say. For this reappearance, I have added some
  useful notes.]

  In certain parts of the world, people still sit around their fires at dusk and tell
  each other stories. In the wretched village where Marigold Chew grew up, there was
  one tale in particular that was told over and over again. This was the story of
  Tadeusz Kapisko and his ears of wheat. It was told so often--sometimes three or
  four times in a single evening--that it was embedded in Marigold''s brain, and years
  later, she could recount it word for word, barely pausing for breath. Dobson always
  knew when she was about to launch into the yarn, because she sucked in her cheeks
  and puckered her lips in what he thought of as "that Kapisko way".

  Curiously, the tale of Tadeusz Kapisko and his ears of wheat was never written down,
  but if Marigold Chew''s memory is accurate, there was a record of sorts. She remembered,
  as an infant, seeing pictorial representations of the main points of the story,
  richly painted in crimson, cerulean blue and orpiment. Later in life, she tried
  to describe them.

  I recall that the first picture was of Tadeusz Kapisko half hidden behind a cow.
  It was, decisively, a French cow, une vache. I remember thinking how significant
  this was, even as a tiny tot. The second picture was the shape of a medallion. The
  painter overdid the orpiment, but what I loved about this one was that it showed
  the exact moment of a hen''s cluck. Tadeusz Kapisko is absent. I think we were meant
  to infer that he had already gone off to war. Certainly that is the import of the
  third picture, in which the Kapisko parents are shown filling rusty farmyard pails
  with their tears. I could almost taste the salt of their sobbing, as they waited
  for the wheat.

  Picture four was missing, it had been torn out, you could still see the ghost shade
  of its adhesive. Some brute or vandal had scribbled over the fifth picture with
  an indelible black marker pen, and the sixth had been chewed by squirrels. So it
  was always a joy to look at the seventh, in which we see Tadeusz Kapisko with his
  ears of wheat at last, returned from the trenches minus one eye, leaning against
  the shed in which all the rusty farmyard pails full of his parents'' tears are kept.
  He is smoking a cheroot and looks the spit and image of Josef Starling, though his
  hair has been painted in cerulean blue with flecks of orpiment which may be accidental.

  The eighth picture is like a child''s drawing. It shows the helicopters on the helipad,
  the burning cities, and the pit of doom, making the next picture all the more alluring,
  the delightful wash of colours showing meadows dotted with teasel, spurge, gentians,
  camellias, columbine, bedstraw and edelweiss, honeysuckle, lupins and phlox. And
  hollyhocks, hollyhocks.

  "Oooh, mama! Papa!" I used to pipe, as I turned to picture number ten, "Where are
  Tadeusz Kapisko''s ears of wheat?" And my parents would always smile conspiratorially
  and place their fingers over their mouths, and I adored the anticipation of seeing
  the eleventh and last picture, all crimson and cerulean blue and orpiment, King''s
  yellow, the frying pan and the hunchback, the countless pigs wallowing in their
  muck, the detective with his buttons and the unshelled peas still snug in their
  pods, the glockenspiel and the fire extinguisher, the tiny glittering ships afloat
  on the soaking wet sea, and there, if you looked ever so closely, on the poop deck
  of the tiniest ship of all, triumphant in his galoshes, with his ears of wheat,
  Tadeusz Kapisko, brave and strong!

  NOTES

  In certain parts of the world, people still sit around their fires at dusk and tell
  each other stories. One such part of the world, I have learned, is a house on Jethro
  Tull Gardens, a cul-de-sac in a village in Oxfordshire. There, night after night
  after night, folk gather around a fire to tell each other stories based on Jethro
  Tull song lyrics. They transform Mr Anderson''s rhymes into prose, creating afresh
  tales of minstrels in galleries, heavy horses, Jeffrey going to Leicester Square,
  and other marvels.

  Tadeusz Kapisko. This appears to be a Polish spelling. It has been given elsewhere
  as Thaddeus Capisco. Without knowing the precise location of the wretched village
  where Marigold Chew grew up, we cannot plump for one spelling or the other. One
  thing we can be fairly sure of, however, is that Marigold Chew did not grow up in
  Jethro Tull Gardens. I think we would know, if she had. Or do I mean if she did?
  Had? Did? Do? Be? Doobedoobedoo.

  a French cow. I have long wondered if this French cow is related to the laughing
  cow, a red cow usually spotted on the paper element of the packaging of foil-wrapped
  processed cheese triangles. For certain children, brought up in blasted urban wastelands
  far from the bosky charms of a rustic idyll, this is the first, and possibly only,
  cow they have ever seen.

  Mention of the cow reminds me to draw your attention to the latest media report
  of a cow attack, which I am pleased to note refers in passing to David Blunkett.
  It also includes the immortal line: "It''s hard to comprehend just how big a cow
  is until you''re underneath one, looking up at it."

  Josef Starling. Paranoid, pock-marked Georgian, dictator of the Soviet Union, died
  in 1953. Often confused with Clarice Stalin, heroine of The Silence Of The Cows
  Lambs, a potboiler by Thomas Harris.

  the burning cities. Possibly the same burning cities alluded to in Nine Funerals
  Of A Citizen King by Henry Cow. I have searched in vain on maps for a cul-de-sac
  called Henry Cow Gardens.


  WITH DOBSON IN THE LAND OF NOD

  Some time ago we mentioned that Dobson compiled a gazetteer of the Land of Nod,
  the place to where Cain was banished after he slew his brother Abel. Dobson, of
  course, never travelled to the Holy Land, nor indeed to Nod. What he did, however,
  was to rent a field and build a scale model using firewood, netting, straw, plastic
  packaging, paint, plasticine and corrugated cardboard, among other things. Careful
  analysis of the Bible and other historical records meant that Dobson''s model Nod
  is probably as close as we could get to appreciating the blasted land in which the
  first murderer lived out his miserable days. Here is a charming old goat-shed; here
  is a clump of cypress trees shrivelled by drought; here is a Von Danikenesque landing
  strip for an extraterrestrial spaceship; here are tares and bushels, asps and vipers,
  and a river of burning pitch.

  Dobson built Nod before writing his gazetteer, which runs to eight closely-typed
  pages illustrated with cack-handed pencil drawings. The text has been ridiculed
  by Biblical scholars, who accuse Dobson of poltroonery, undue haste, credulousness
  and stupidity. Such criticisms were swatted aside by the out-of-print pamphleteer
  like so many flies, midges, ticks, or similar tiny flying pests, well-represented,
  incidentally, in the model Land of Nod, where Dobson had hit upon the idea of using
  chocolate-flavoured one hundreds and thousands, scattered hither and thither around
  the rented field, to show swarms of buzzing and twanging insect life. For larger
  forms such as locusts, he used cashew nuts, delicately carved by volunteers from
  the Pang Hill Orphanage, some of whom lost their eyesight carrying out such painstaking
  miniature work for days on end in the dank and gloomy basement of the building.

  Dobson believed that receipts from visitors'' fees to his model Nod would provide
  him with an income in his declining years. It was not to be. On a damp and overcast
  Tuesday in 1964, the field was laid waste by an inexplicable cataclysm, the day
  before Marigold Chew was due to photograph it using a borrowed camera. The Land
  of Nod was swept away, swept away and gone.


  GIVE ME A GLOSSARY

  Dear Mr Key, writes Tim Thurn, I enjoy reading Hooting Yard and usually find it
  both instructive and enlightening. However, I must say that the piece entitled When
  Haddo-Haddo Becomes Musto [yesterday] left me somewhat jolt-brained. It is unlikely
  that you would write complete nonsense, so perhaps I am missing something. Could
  I prevail upon you to provide some sort of glossary to help in my appreciation and
  understanding? Yours perplexed, Tim Thurn

  For you, Tim, anything. Here is a glossary of some of the crucial words and passages.

  the times when haddo-haddo becomes musto : Usually between 4.00 and 4.30 p.m. on
  Wednesday afternoons, particularly when it is raining or about to rain.

  the tocks : Suggestive of both toxin, a poisonous substance generated in an animal
  body (animals may include cows, crows, cormorants, squirrels and ducks, among many
  others) and tocsin, an alarm-bell. Dobson once began some notes on "the tocks of
  a toxin tocsin" but discarded them, and wisely so.

  the greaves of way-o : Impenetrable.

  an eel : The generation of eels has long been a mystery. Aristotle believed they
  "grew from the guts of wet soil", that they emerged, unfertilised, from mud. We
  now know that all eels are spawned in the Sargasso Sea, but no one has ever seen
  it happen.

  the cat : Note the definite article, signalling that a particular cat is being referred
  to. Teasingly, we are not given the name of the cat. Popular cat names include Tiddles,
  Marmalade, Napoleon, Bootpolish, and Gravitas, so it may be one of them.

  fenland : Not Finland, fenland. Are there any fens in Finland? I don''t know, but
  I''ll find out.

  a new biro : Writing implement named after Laszlo Jozsef Biro (1899-1985), a Hungarian
  journalist, although his brother Georg, a chemist, played an important part in developing
  the ball-point mechanism. Biro''s birthday, 19th September, is celebrated as Argentine
  Inventors'' Day in the Argentine. The Biro brothers moved to that country in 1943.

  ha''penny salt tokens : paper or cardboard tokens, worth one half penny in pre-decimal
  currency (worthless at today''s prices, and though only thirty four years dead,
  seemingly as historically distant as the groat), which could be exchanged for salt.
  How many grains, or fistfuls, of salt you got for your ha''penny was subject to
  fluctuation. Some believed that the token-to-salt ratio moved in spooky parallel
  with planetary conjunctions, and at least one ha''penny salt token astrolabe is
  known to have been constructed, though by whom, when, where and why is not known,
  nor will it ever be known, yea, unto the umpteenth generation.

  toads : probably natterjack, or golden, ah! all golden and poisonous.


  NOMENCLATURE OF DIMINUTIVE PERSONS WHO PLUNGE DOWN 150-FT CLIFFS AND SURVIVE WITH
  HARDLY A SCRATCH

  The most recent addition to our list which attempts a complete nomenclature of diminutive
  persons who survive after toppling over the edge of cliffs is Demi-Leigh Tweddle.
  The wonderfully-named Ms Tweddle meets the diminutiveness criterion in that she
  is a six year old child. Last week, she tumbled one hundred and fifty feet down
  the cliffs at Chimney Hole, near Filey, in North Yorkshire, while playing roly poly.
  When she reached the bottom, she simply picked herself up and walked around to find
  her parents.

  Demi-Leigh Tweddle should not be confused with Dairylea Twaddle, which is a generic
  term for the advertising guff spouted by the makers of foil-wrapped processed cheese
  triangles and similar produce.

  Rumours that your esteemed editor has changed his name to Demi-Frank Key are inaccurate
  and can be discounted.


  BILLY PARALLELOGRAM

  Hands up those of you who remember the cartoon character Billy Parallelogram. For
  decades in the last century he appeared weekly in The Pabulum, a comic which also
  featured Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet. Whereas all Magnet Boy! The Boy Magnet''s adventures
  followed a strict, unchanging formula, you could never guess what might happen in
  the Billy Parallelogram strip. Sometimes he was accompanied by his cousin, Tilly
  Dodecahedron, or by the Massed Hordes Of Gruesome And Frightening Things From The
  Pit Of Foulness. Sometimes the weekly adventure might be as simplistic as Billy
  Parallelogram buying an accordion and learning how to play it. There were serial
  stories, too, spread over two or three months, where Billy Parallelogram would be
  shown teaching children how to cultivate wheat, or to devise spring, prong and lever
  mechanisms to automate household tasks, or even to compose majestic symphonies for
  full orchestra so emotionally charged that listeners would blub into their handkerchiefs.
  His cousin Tilly Dodecahedron''s appearances often signalled storylines involving
  bees, turpentine, silhouetteists, farm implements and Dakkadakkadakka. This last
  was a speciality of the Billy Parallelogram strips, an ill-defined yet curiously
  unnerving monster goblin with bulging eyes and forehead, seemingly bent on destroying
  the universe but always distracted by parlour games such as snakes-and-ladders or
  gluttons-and-rhubarb.

  My favourite Billy Parallelogram story was the one in which he single-handedly thwarts
  the evil designs of a mad scientist called Weems. Weems is blond and has eerily
  sparkling blue eyes, and is always dressed in a trenchcoat. There is an inference,
  never made explicit, that he is some kind of Nazi. Also never made explicit is precisely
  what his evil scheme is, other than that it involves the enslavement of the world''s
  entire population. How he is meant to accomplish this from the cockpit of an antiquated
  sea-plane is unclear, but before we have time to consider such questions, Billy
  Parallelogram heroically tampers with the fuel gauge, leading Weems to think he
  is out of petrol. The plane crashes into a mountainside, killing Weems and his fiendish
  crew, but not before Billy Parallelogram bails out and lands in the courtyard of
  a pie shop, where he is hailed as a saviour and given free pies for life.


  METAL OF THE WEEK : TIN

  This week''s Hooting Yard Metal of the Week is tin.

  Many words rhyme with tin, such as bin, din, sin, gin, Rumpelstiltskin, and pin.
  For this reason, it is quite easy to make up verses about tin. Harder, though, to
  ensure that those verses have something arresting, urgent and original to say, especially
  about tin, if it is the main subject of the poem. Let us imagine that you have been
  commissioned by a maker of calico prints to sing the praises of tin chloride as
  a reducing agent and as a mordant. I doubt very much that you would be able to dash
  off a suitable poem just by listing the words that rhyme with tin. But perhaps you
  are more accomplished as a poet than I am.

  In his pamphlet Astrochemistry : A Study of Metal-Planet Affinities (Emergence Press,
  1984), Nick Kollerstrom writes Tin is the one metal of the seven which does not
  show much evidence of its planet''s signature. I asked an astrologer about this
  and he replied: ''Why, how could it? The Jupiter attributes--expansion, joviality,
  wisdom--how could a metal express these?'' How indeed? It seems that with tin we
  have to be content with only a very partial expression of the planet traditionally
  associated with it. Mr Kollerstrom does not explain how a big lump of rock, metallic
  hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, and gaseous hydrogen orbiting the sun millions of miles
  away "expresses" expansion, joviality, and wisdom, but I am sure he knows what he
  is talking about, because he makes a point of stressing that he is an MA Cantab,
  and thus no ordinary mortal.

  Dobson was no ordinary mortal either, for different reasons. As one might expect,
  he turned his attentions to tin on a number of occasions, chiefly in the pamphlet
  he called simply Tin Book. He set himself the task of mentioning tin once on the
  first page, twice on the second page, and so on until the final page included forty-four
  mentions of the silvery, malleable poor metal that is not easily oxidized in air
  and resists corrosion. This leads to somewhat idiotic passages such as this, from
  page ten:

  I stood on the mountainside in the rain. There was a crow perched on my head, and
  its talons clawed at my scalp, but I had swallowed an anti-crow-clawing-pain pill
  an hour earlier. I peered into the rain-sodden gloom until I could make out the
  weather vane in the far distance. Conditions were perfect for the Shouting The Names
  Of Metals At The Sky experiment. "Tin!" I yelled, "Tin tin tin tin tin tin tin tin
  tin!"

  Dobsonian scholars have got themselves into something of a tizz arguing whether
  the out-of-print pamphleteer is describing actual events in Tin Book, or just making
  them up. My own view is that it hardly matters.

  To end this fascinating look at our Metal of the Week, try to lodge the following
  fact in your cranium. At low temperatures, tin exists as gray or alpha tin, which
  has a cubic crystal structure similar to silicon. When warmed above 13.2 degC it
  changes into white or beta tin, which is metallic and has a tetragonal structure.
  Alpha tin ought not be confused with the Alpha Course, created by Nicky Gumbel,
  which propounds a reductive and distorted version of Christianity, nor with Alpha
  males. Dobson, by the way, once described himself as an Epsilon male, but quite
  what he meant by that is far from clear.

  DIETARY NEWS

  Many years ago, I decided to experiment by living on a subsistence diet of gruel
  for a while. (I do hope my readers understand that this is a true story.) I think
  I was pandering to my ascetic, puritanical streak. For the duration of the exercise,
  I eschewed all other foodstuffs, even to the point where I was tempted neither by
  pap nor by slops. Around the same time I read somewhere that krill was the Food
  of the Future. This appealed to me hugely, but gruel seemed easier to come by than
  krill.

  This is by way of introduction to my recent discovery of another alleged Food of
  the Future, in the form of poi, a thoroughly exciting dish from Hawaii. Poi is made
  from the taro plant, which is apparently the fourteenth most cultivated crop on
  earth. The root or corm of the taro is cooked for hours and hours and then pounded
  into a sticky goo that has the consistency of library paste, which makes it especially
  appealing to those of us who are bookish. One of the other great things about poi
  is that you can dispense with cutlery, as it is shovelled daintily into the mouth
  using your bare hands.

  So if you are on the lookout for a sour paste to serve as your staple diet, poi
  seems to be the thing. Maybe after eating a delicious bowl of the goo, you may wish
  to engage in fire dancing, fire twirling, fire spinning, or fire swinging, for all
  of which you can use fire poi. If you wish to know more, I suggest that you join
  an online fire twirler community.

  Food and fire... who ever said Hooting Yard was not a repository of essential information
  for a fulfilling life?'
