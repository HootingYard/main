full_text: 'PEAS

  They''re small, green, solid, edible spheres, and you eke them from pods. I am talking
  about peas, of course! Let us sing their praises:

  At the dinner tables of Hooting Yard / There''s a food we hold in high regard /
  Oh I wonder what can it be? / It''s the little green edible sphere called the pea!

  The shelling of peas has long been recognised as a therapeutic activity on a par
  with pig observation. Some doctors of the brain recommend that neurasthenic patients
  should spend an hour each day shelling peas and another hour leaning over the fence
  of a sty watching pigs. The experimental psychiatrist Tarpin Paltrow suggested doing
  both at the same time, with results that have been hotly debated ever since.

  It was Paltrow''s student P K Spaceman who coined the term PQ, for pea quotient.
  Your PQ is easily calculated. Take the number of peas you have eaten in your lifetime,
  and divide it by your age. This figure can be plotted on a grid against, for example,
  your body mass index, rotundity of head, shoe size, and various phrenological data.
  Dr Spaceman was fond of citing Lloyd George''s view that Neville Chamberlain had
  "a wrong-shaped head" and put this down to a lack of peas in the latter''s diet.
  Sometimes he attributed it to a lack of peas in the former''s diet, too.

  In desperate circumstances, for example when one''s life is at risk, peas can become
  useful tools, or at least adjuncts to tools. There is the story of the Antarctic
  explorer, clinging by his frostbitten fingertips to the edge of a crevasse down
  which he was about to plunge, who managed to clamber up on to the ice by fashioning
  a harness using ribbons, elastic bands and frozen peas.


  The out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson once planned to write an Encyclopaedia Of Pea
  Varieties And Pea Recipes, but he abandoned the project after cracking his shin
  bone on a metal drum. The drum had been left directly outside his front door by
  a peripatetic person who ought to have been shelling peas and observing pigs, for
  this person could say, as Stanley Baldwin did, "My inside is a mess of cold rumbling
  fluidity. My brain is costive. Faith is dying. Hope is dead". So miserable was this
  travelling drum person that he could no longer bear to carry his drum from place
  to place, and so with a sigh like a dying wind he unhitched it from his back and
  placed it in Dobson''s driveway. Then he rolled it as far as the front door, and
  scribbled a note on the wrapper of a toffee apple, weighted the note on the drum
  with a pebble, and trudged away to begin his life anew as the Man of Bandages. You
  might be wondering what the note said. It was simple enough.

  "I can no longer carry my metal drum from place to place. Keep it or discard it,
  I care not a jot."

  As we have seen, upon discovering the drum, Dobson''s first act was neither to keep
  nor to discard it, but to bang his leg against it with such force that he almost
  broke the bone of the shin of his right leg.

  Why did Dobson''s leg meet the cold hard edge of the metal drum with such force?

  Because Dobson was charging out of his house at high speed--so fast that he would
  have appeared to any passer by as a mere blur, like the comic book character Billy
  Whizz.

  Dobson was normally slow and even lumbering of gait. On what account was he in such
  a hurry?

  Always a man with an eye for a bargain, Dobson had just received a message on his
  metal tapping machine telling him that in a marquee tent pitched in a field beyond
  Pang Hill, a mountebank was selling many peas at prices that were described as "insane".
  Given that he was thinking hard about his planned pea book, this seemed an opportunity
  too good to miss. Hence the way in which he jumped up from his escritoire, sending
  his chair clattering behind him, kicked off his toofles with vim, enwrapped himself
  in his big black coat, stuck his feet into a pair of Canadian Forestry Service boots,
  and whizzed out of his front door. His momentum was at this point brought to a shocking
  halt by the unexpected metal drum blocking his path. Making contact with it, Dobson
  howled. Many people in the vicinity said later that they thought what they heard
  was a dog being clubbed by a brute, a la Bill Sykes in Oliver Twist, as played by
  the late Oliver Reed in the film version of Lionel Bart''s musical Oliver! Persistent
  rumours that Bart intended to follow this with a setting of another Victorian literary
  gem, Gerard Manley Hopkins'' poem The Wreck Of The Deutschland, entitled The Tall
  Nun!, are unfounded.


  Did Dobson read the note left by the peripatetic person who had abandoned the metal
  drum?

  No he did not. Nor, once his shin wound was anointed with unguents and wrapped in
  a bandage, did he go to the marquee tent in the field to buy peas from a mountebank
  at "insane" prices. Had he done so, he would have discovered that the insanity of
  the prices lay not in their cheapness but, conversely, in the fact that each individual
  pea was on sale for a sum so staggeringly expensive that it beggared belief. Many
  historians of the social scene have pondered the motives of the mountebank, who
  was not trying to pretend there was anything special about the peas he had for sale.
  Indeed, his patter, if we can call it that, consisted of the repeated phrase "Come
  hither and buy yourself a pea at an insanely expensive price, townspeople!", shouted
  in an accent difficult to pin down, and shouted repeatedly throughout the long afternoon
  as clouds scudded across the sky and birds sang, and the planets span in space millions
  of miles away.

  Peas have been compared with planets, sometimes, by poets. The author of the song
  we heard at the beginning of this piece wrote other pea-related verses, in one of
  which he takes each planet in turn--using the mnemonic "mud, vinegar, ectoplasm,
  moorhens, jasper, straubenzee, unspeakable, Nixon, popinjay" -- and contemplates
  them as peas in a pod, not yet shelled by one of Dr Spaceman''s wild-eyed brain-sick
  patients. There is no mention of pigs in the poem. Make of that what you will.


  JEANETTE WINTERSON PLEASE NOTE

  If you wish to become weak-headed, nervous, and good for nothing, read novels. I
  have seen an account of a young lady, who had become so nervous and excitable, in
  consequence of reading novels, that her head would be turned by the least appearance
  of danger, real or imaginary. As she was riding in a carriage over a bridge, in
  company with her mother and sister, she became frightened at some fancied danger,
  caught hold of the reins, and backed the carriage off the bridge, down a precipice,
  dashing them to pieces.

  THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN

  Some readers will be familiar with the career of the Sino-Dutch artist Ah-Fang Van
  Der Houygendorp, the man who invented potato-peel engravure. Few people know, however,
  that he was a keen mountaineer. Keen and inept, that is. Ah-Fang was, if nothing
  else, a visionary, and he had visions of a haunted mountain, its peak shrouded in
  inexplicable purple mists like something out of a novel by M P Shiel. Whenever he
  sat shivering in his tent at base camp, Ah-Fang wondered if this mountain, the one
  he was about to climb, was the haunted mountain of his mind''s eye. He would poke
  his head out of the frayed flap of his tent, peer up at the majestic rock formation
  disappearing into the clouds above, and wonder if this, at last, would be the one
  he had dreamed of since childhood, where he would come face to face with the uncanny,
  the ineffable.

  Physically, Ah-Fang was not really cut out for mountaineering. He was described
  by a contemporary as "a figure of untold puniness", and he was indeed tiny and weak,
  short-sighted, lanky and prone to swooning fits. He was terrified of gnats, horseflies
  and fruitbats. He had an oversensitive digestive system and had to subsist mostly
  on thin soup or broth. It was difficult to find a mountaineering team willing to
  recruit so wretched a specimen, so Ah-Fang did most of his clambering up sheer rock
  faces solo, a man alone testing himself against the elements.

  What he lacked in physical prowess, Ah-Fang made up for with a genius for publicity.
  Each time he descended from some pitiless escarpment, battered, bruised, hallucinating
  and in the last stages of exhaustion, the puny alpinist would hold a press conference.
  At one of these, in 1929, he was questioned closely by Dobson. No one is quite sure
  what in heaven''s name Dobson was doing hanging about in the foothills of the Giant
  Terrifying Mountains of Tantarabim at the time. We know from the journals of Marigold
  Chew that Dobson was at work on a series of pamphlets about glue, breadcrumbs and
  the composer William Hurlstone (1876-1906), whose Bassoon Sonata made him weep,
  and that he collected the tears in what he called his "Hurlstone bucket". It is
  beyond doubt, however, that Dobson bustled through the entrance flap of Ah-Fang
  Van Der Houygendorp''s tent within minutes of the mountaineer''s return from the
  jagged heights of Giant Terrifying Mountain Number Eight, the most challenging of
  the peaks in the Tantarabim range. The transcript of their conversation has been
  preserved.


  William Hurlstone

  Ah-Fang : Welcome to my press conference.

  Dobson : With all due respect, you look very puny for a mountaineer.

  Ah-Fang : I have seen things, up in yon mists and clouds, that no human being has
  ever seen. I want you to tell the world.

  Dobson : The lenses of your spectacles are extremely thick, and what I know of the
  ocular sciences would suggest to me that you are myopic. Added to which, they are
  steamed up. Your claim to have seen anything at all, let alone something of great
  import, is, frankly, somewhat dubious.

  Ah-Fang : Frankly dubious it may well be, O person with notebook and pencil, but
  I know whereof I speak, for I was upon that mighty peak engulfed in mists, and you
  were not.

  Dobson : That''s true enough. An hour ago I was sitting in one of the huts in these
  foothills eating porridge. I fled the hut when I saw three bears approaching. I
  did not know bears roamed these foothills. Were there more bears up on the mountain?

  Ah-Fang : Yes, there were bears up there, and there were other things beginning
  with B.

  Dobson : What were those things beginning with B?

  Ah-Fang : I could prattle a list of nouns beginning with B, pamphlet person, and
  you would scuttle away happy, but of greater import is the sort of general mental
  impression I gained within the mist, an impression which impinged upon my brain
  in a manner that can only be described as uncanny and redoubtable. For I have witnessed
  that which I knew from infancy awaited me. Even as a tiny tot I was aware that in
  some broiling high altitude mist I would come upon the elixir of glory.

  Dobson : Let me stop you there, puny mountaineer. I need to sharpen my pencil. Do
  you have a pencil sharpener?

  Ah-Fang : Let me look in my voluminous kitbag.

  Dobson : Thank you. While you rummage, I am going to hike up the mountain myself,
  to add credence to your witterings.

  The transcript ends there. For the rest of his life, Dobson never spoke of what
  he found at the top of that mystic and magical mountain. If asked, he would stare
  balefully into the distance, as if entranced. But he did write an account of what
  he found when he returned to Ah-Fang''s base camp. It appears as a lengthy footnote
  in his out-of-print pamphlet He Who Plucks The Strings Of A Banjo In Wintry, Wintry
  Weather.

  "When I descended from Giant Terrifying Mountain Number Eight," he wrote, "I expected
  to find puny alpinist Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp awaiting me with a pencil sharpener
  in his frostbitten hand. I even thought he may have sharpened my pencil for me in
  my absence, as an act of beneficence. I was in a reflective mood, whistling William
  Hurlstone''s Snow White''s Death-Sleep, from The Magic Mirror, as I trudged towards
  the tent. There were grim, huge-winged birds circling overhead, and I gripped harder
  the piece of putty in my pocket. Bustling through the flap, as I always bustle through
  tent-flaps, I found no trace of Ah-Fang, nor of my pencil. The man had vanished
  with his kitbag, his pencil sharpener, and, I adduced, he had acted like a common
  thief by taking my pencil with him. I had lost track of time up on the mountain,
  so I could not guess how long he had been gone. I wondered if, puny as he was, he
  had been waylaid by the bears who roam those ill-starred foothills, and I half expected
  to find a pile of chewed bones as I made my sad way to the railway station along
  the luminous painted footpaths. But I saw no bones, no bears, nothing at all beginning
  with B, in all the hours it took me to plod away from that weird, unwelcoming place.
  I never saw Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp again, but a year later I learned that he
  was a passenger aboard the airship the LZ 129 Hindenburg, which exploded in flames
  while approaching a mooring mast at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in the state of
  New Jersey in the United States of America. I often find myself wondering if the
  stub of my pencil was aboard that doomed airship."



  CRISIS IN THE SEDGE

  Occasionally, if you observe closely, it is possible to watch a crisis developing
  in a clump of sedge. On any given day, the crisis may involve sedge warblers* (a
  type of bird), but is unlikely to match the features of any of the Six Crises examined
  by Richard Milhous Nixon in his 1962 book of that title.

  Sedge crises tend to be riverbanky by definition, so in addition to the aforementioned
  sedge warblers, one may also find that otters, frogs or hand-carved wooden decoy
  ducks are involved. In the case of frogs, it is advisable to make tape recordings
  of their croaks. These can then be analysed at leisure, back in the comfort of one''s
  laboratory, attended by Mungo the disfigured factotum. It is not recommended to
  make recordings of any quacks which seem to have the decoy ducks as their source,
  as these are of course utterly fraudulent and many hours diligent lab time will
  be wasted as a result. If one has to pay rental for the laboratory space, this can
  be financially ruinous, thus compromising one''s ability to resolve a sedge crisis,
  in some instances fatally.

  Note that most common sedge crises can be dealt with quite effectively by the amateur,
  and the whole thing should blow over within a week. Special patrol units, dedicated
  to this type of work, ought to be called in if the crisis lasts longer. Telephone
  numbers for more than a dozen such teams can be found in the Directory of Sedge
  Crisis Resources, available by mail order. Unfortunately, there are some impostors
  who prey on the naive and the credulous. Genuine crisis teams will always, always
  wear caps with ear-flaps.

  As soon as possible after the sedge crisis has been dealt with, a full written report,
  in the international standard format, must be submitted to the authorities. This
  is a legal requirement, and failure to comply will result in criminal charges and
  deportation to a secret facility disguised as a cream cracker factory, where the
  malefactor will be poked at with forks and bashed on the head with a big iron utensil.


  * NOTE : Even if one is dealing with a warblerless sedge crisis, it is important
  to learn to recognise these birds so that they can be discounted from one''s considerations.
  Above is a picture of a sedge warbler, by clicking on which one will be able to
  hear what the damned thing sounds like. Hooting Yard is grateful to the always-exciting
  Latvian Birding website for this warbling.


  MY LITTLE BLIND DOLLY

  I have a little blind dolly. She is stuffed with straw. I have not named her yet.
  I have only had her for half an hour. I found her on a patch of waste ground, half
  an hour ago. I was out walking. I suppose I should say I was out limping, because
  I limp when I walk. My left leg is shorter than my right leg on account of a mysterious
  childhood illness. I was limping along near the canal when I passed a patch of waste
  ground and saw the blind dolly stuffed with straw. She had been abandoned, possibly
  by some ungrateful infant. Ingratitude is the besetting sin of today''s infants.
  That is my opinion, not shared by all. Rooting around on the waste ground I noticed
  other things, including a pair of blue buttons. I think I can say with some confidence
  that they were made of bakelite. I supposed that they may have been the eyes of
  my little blind dolly once upon a time. But they had become detached, perhaps when
  she was thrown with a certain amount of violence on to the patch of waste ground
  from the wound-down window of a Chevrolet passing at high speed in the back seat
  of which an ungrateful infant was throwing a tantrum. That would fit the facts as
  I found them. I did think about sewing the buttons back on to my little blind dolly''s
  cloth head, about twenty five minutes ago, but decided against doing so. She has
  been robbed of her sight and I do not presume to play God. I have placed both buttons
  in my pocket, however, in case they come in handy for another purpose, a purpose
  which will be revealed to me at the due time. For the moment I am concerned with
  selecting a name for my little blind dolly. No doubt the ungrateful infant who tossed
  her aside had a name for her, but in twenty thousand years I would be unable to
  guess what it was. It is not as if she has her name embroidered on the sole of her
  cloth foot. At home I have a whole shelf full of books by Tony Buzan. They are all
  packed with tips to make better use of my brain, but not one of them tells me how
  to pronounce the author''s name. Is it BOO-z''n or Byoo-ZAN? Until I find out, my
  little blind dolly will have to have two names. She will be Susan Buzan or Suzanne
  Buzan. I am going to make a little black cape for her to wear, just like Tony Buzan''s
  cape, only smaller, because she is not a living breathing mind map maker, she is
  just my little blind dolly. I will find a small piece of cloth for the cape, and
  if it is not already black, I will have to dye it, or smear it all over with black
  boot polish. I have got more black boot polish than I know what to do with. I often
  think about that song by Jethro Tull, Doctor Bogenbroom, because I bought all the
  boot polish from a cobbler named Mister Bogenbroom when he shut up his shop. He
  told me he was going to sea, but he did not say which sea he meant. It could have
  been the Baltic, the Red, or the Dead, or one of the other ones. I didn''t ask him,
  because he was quite a frightening man, and in those days I did not have my little
  blind dolly to hide behind. But now I have, and nothing will ever frighten me again.


  "THE HUMANE VOICE IS AIR, IMPREGNATED, AND..."

  "The Humane Voice is Air, impregnated, and made Sonorous by the impressed Character
  of the Life, or is such, as whilst it is in breathing forth, doth smite upon the
  Organs of the Voice, so, as they tremble thereupon; for indeed, without this tremulous
  Motion, no Voice is made: Yea, not only the Larynx, or Wind-pipe, doth thereupon
  tremble, but the whole Skull also; yea, and sometimes all the Bones of the whole
  Body, which any one may easily find in himself, by his applying his Hand to his
  Throat, and laying it on the top of his Head." -- John Conrade Amman, The Talking
  Deaf Man'
