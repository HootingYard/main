full_text: 'TOTAL ECLIPSE

  One day, after a huge breakfast, Ignapfando had a total eclipse of the heart, just
  like that songstress whose name escapes me. He did not look as if it was happening.
  Indeed to the untrained eye Ignapfando looked as if he was asleep, rather than in
  the throes of convulsive emotional turmoil accompanied by strident rock music. Adding
  to the disjuncture was the fact that Ignapfando resembled Clement Attlee, down to
  the finicky moustache and an inadvisable line in hats. Nevertheless, when he went
  to his priest for confession the following Sunday, there could be no doubt about
  the upheavals of his passion.

  "Bless me father for I have sinned," he pleaded as he knelt facing the grille behind
  which the priest sat clutching his rosary beads and wishing he was Montgomery Clift
  in I Confess. "I have had a total eclipse of the heart."

  "Let me stop you there, my child," murmured the priest, "I have heard enough. Say
  three Our Fathers, four Hail Marys, and one An Evil Cradling by Brian Keenan. Now
  get you gone."

  Ignapfando left the confessional. Soon afterwards, so did the priest, his own heart
  not so much in total eclipse as heavy with the weight of the fat black sins he had
  had to listen to all morning. Terrible, terrible sins, of impiety and vainglory
  and greed, of abandonment and lust, of twiddly Moog synthesiser solos, rapine, pillage
  and wrack. He imagined each sin as a lump of lead, and he stuffed them all into
  a sack. It was a burlap sack, tied up with a knot, and he hoisted it onto his back.
  His back was broad, and his shoulders were strong, and he carried the sack through
  all the day long, the sack of sins as black as his heart, and at nightfall he tossed
  it onto a cart. He reined up his horse in the milky moon''s glow, and off he rode
  with the sack on the cart. Ignapfando tossed and turned in his attic of sin with
  his total eclipse of the heart.

  Dawn came. Ignapfando awoke refreshed, all sin washed away, a man who now was pure.
  Far, far away on the road to the lime kilns, the priest with his horse and cart
  and sack full of sin had stopped to drink water from a stream. It was a pretty rill.
  As if in a dream, the songstress appeared, standing in the long grass, dressed in
  no longer fashionable glam finery. There was a sudden din. Was it the music of the
  spheres as conceived in the Mind of Brian May? The priest clapped his hands over
  his ears, his horse reared up in terror, and the burlap sack exploded, its incandescence
  vapourising the sun, the blast almost as loud as the songstress and her band, belting
  out her anthem.

  This much have I seen. This much have I heard.


  A NOTE ON BAGS

  Yesterday, in the piece dealing with Dobson''s abortive soup encyclopaedia, we mentioned
  in passing the Old Testament Book of Haggai. This brief text is a favourite of mine.
  It mentions pottage, of course, which is always a good thing, but also includes
  the phrase "he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes"(1:6).

  I have always felt a pang of sympathy for that man, whoever he may be. He is the
  only person in the Bible who carries a bag with holes, a bag so unlike the ones
  mentioned in Luke 12:33, "bags which wax not old... where no thief approacheth,
  neither moth corrupteth". Clearly the Haggai man has allowed moths to corrupt his
  bag, and that is why it has holes in it.

  I can''t help wondering if he is a little simple, this man, to be putting his wages
  into a moth-eaten bag. He is a prototype of the Holy Innocent or the Holy Fool,
  perhaps, that mythic figure which had such resonance in Tsarist Russia, among other
  times and places. Rasputin certainly exploited the idea for all it was worth, and
  although there is no reliable account of him roaming the corridors of the Winter
  Palace carrying a bag with holes, I like to think he did. At the end, of course,
  his assassins had such trouble doing him to death that they shot him at least three
  times, so it is possible that any bag he had with him at the time would have had
  a hole or holes caused by gunfire, even if it had escaped corruption by moths.


  Ra--Ra--Rasputin

  To my knowledge, no one has yet pursued a close study of moth infestations in the
  Tsarist palaces, but if someone with the requisite scholarly background were to
  do so, we may learn something of importance. I am not sure whether the moths lying
  in wait to feed on Rasputin''s bag would have been Alder moths, or Antler, Autumnal,
  Bee, Black Mountain, Black V, Black-veined, Broom, Cabbage, Crimson-speckled, Cynthia,
  December, Dew, Drinker, Ear, Early, Emperor, Fisher''s Estuarine, Fox, Garden Pebble,
  Ghost, Goat, Great Peacock, Gypsy, Heart, Hornet, Leopard, Lobster, March, Meal,
  Mouse, Muslin, Netted Mountain, Ni, Northern Winter, November, Orache, Orange, Pale
  November, Peppered, Puss, Spanish Moon, Swallow-tailed, Sweet Gale, Turnip, Wax,
  White Satin, or Winter moths, and I would like a top lepidopterist with some knowledge
  of the fall of the Romanovs to tell me.


  A moth

  Readers should note that "the bag of deceitful weights" is not mentioned in Haggai,
  but can be found in Micah 6:11. It would not surprise me to learn that Rasputin
  had such a bag, too, given that he was a deceitful monk as well as the "mad monk"
  of legend. His bag of deceitful weights and bag with holes may have been one and
  the same, of course, a possibility which makes the brain reel. This is the kind
  of historical conundrum that Dobson ought to have written a pamphlet about, but
  never did. If he had, we might be a little further away from bag quandary, and a
  little closer to bag truth.

  "Bag truth" sounds like a Yoko Ono escapade, so the still, small voice of common
  sense whispers in my ear, "be silent now, be silent".


  FIFTY YEARS AGO

  Hard to credit, but it was exactly fifty years ago today that Dobson, the out-of-print
  pamphleteer, made his one and only appearance on the radio. He was booked to appear
  on the then popular show Bad Gas And Forts, a sort of uncategorisable hour of talk,
  static and field recordings hosted by an anonymous spook known only as The Gravel-Voiced
  Ghoul.

  Dobson''s participation was the result of a long campaign by Marigold Chew, who
  spent months standing outside the producer''s office building, holding a flag and
  haranguing passers-by to sign a petition. The producer had sworn an oath that Dobson
  would never appear on the show, apparently because of some otherwise forgotten incident
  involving a rowing boat and a flock of bitterns. Marigold Chew was eventually able
  to prove that the oath contravened the ancient law of civil and pursuivant debaling,
  and it was struck down by magisterium bossa nova in Chancery.

  The show was broadcast live, and no recording was made. However, by pasting together
  the shreds of a hastily-scribbled transcription, it is possible to get some idea
  of what took place. The Ghoul''s first guest was an elderly writer who had defected
  from the Soviet Union. In the immediate post-revolutionary period, he had written
  a series of heart-warming tales about a peasant family under the title Little Yurt
  On The Tundra. With the suppression of the kulaks, and under pressure from the Comintern,
  he rewrote these works as Little Foundry On The Collective Farm. If the transcript
  is reliable, the remarks he made were punctuated by loud hammering noises.

  After about ten minutes, the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul introduced Dobson. Asked to continue
  the theme of cloying family-centred story-telling, the pamphleteer embarked on a
  lengthy anecdote about the books his ma read to him as a child. Here, as far as
  can be pieced together, is what he said:

  "My ma was a huge fan of detective fiction, so my bedtime stories tended to be whatever
  she was reading at the time. One of her favourites was Dorothy Sleet, who wrote
  a series of whodunits featuring Rex Shroud, Orrery Sleuth. Shroud was a sleuth all
  of whose cases involved an orrery at some point in the story. What is that hammering
  noise? Sleet created one of the classic detectives, I think. He may not be quite
  on a par with M P Shiel''s Prince Zaleski, but she put a lot of thought into giving
  the Orrery Sleuth all sorts of idiosyncrasies to make him a memorable and fully-rounded
  character, not just a solver of puzzles. He has a false lung, too many teeth, and
  is a daily practitioner of Baxterism. His lantern is ruby red. At moments of high
  desperation, he will invariably fiddle about with a little tin of talcum powder.
  He keeps blotting paper in his pocket and that hammering is really getting on my
  nerves. Perhaps the best story Dorothy Sleet ever wrote was The Orrery Sleuth And
  The Pod People From The Weird Parallel World Out Of Time And Space. You think you''re
  reading science fiction, but that''s just narrative pyrotechnics. It is, I think,
  both valiant and boisterous, as the best prose always tries to be. She was a woman
  of baleful countenance, Dorothy Sleet, and kept many tortoises in her seaside bungalow.
  She married four times, and each of her husbands vanished unaccountably. The first
  three simply vapourised in the kitchen while making omelettes, and the fourth was
  last seen in Ireland, in the vicinity of the Wobbling Virgin of Ballinspittle."

  At this point the hammering noises drowned out Dobson. By the time they stopped,
  the show had come to an end, and listeners were treated to a concert by Xavier Cugat
  and His Orchestra. Dobson never received a fee for his appearance. Some years later,
  he and the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul passed each other in the street. They did not acknowledge
  each other.


  A Philosopher Giving That Lecture On The Orrery In Which A Lamp Is Put In Place
  Of The Sun by Joseph Wright, 1766. An orrery is called an orrery because one of
  the first ones was made for Charles Boyle (1676-1731), the Fourth Earl of Orrery.


  ORRERY SLEUTH

  On Monday, in the item entitled Fifty Years Ago, we mentioned Dorothy Sleet''s fictional
  detective Rex Shroud, Orrery Sleuth. Sadly, it has come to our attention that not
  a single one of these tremendously exciting novels is still in print. This is all
  the more puzzling when one learns that the Broadway show based on the books is breaking
  box office records.

  The plot of Orrery Sleuth! : The Musical cobbles together incidents from the first
  three novels with certain episodes from Dorothy Sleet''s life. Like Agatha Christie,
  she once disappeared for a few weeks and was found in a seaside boarding-house.
  Like Adolf Hitler, she took seven sugars in her tea. Like the Wild Boy of Aveyron,
  she shrieked when her potatoes were taken away. Like James Joyce, she hid underneath
  tables during thunderstorms. Like William Ewart Gladstone, she adduced from the
  works of Homer that all Ancient Greeks were colour blind. Like Pope Pius XII, she
  gave lectures on gas central heating. Like Hedy Lamarr, she made a decisive scientific
  contribution that helped to win the Second World War. Like Alfred Hitchcock, she
  was frightened of eggs.


  Dorothy Sleet & her phantom familiar

  It is this last point that explains, perhaps, the scene in Act Two of the musical,
  where Rex Shroud, the Orrery Sleuth, finds himself trapped in a little shed, completely
  surrounded by hens. The menacing atmosphere is heightened by the music, a slow,
  brooding theme on woodwinds, accompanied by the chorus delivering a dirge about
  feathers. Brilliantly, the scene segues into a tap-dancing extravaganza and the
  show''s hit number I Am An Orrery Sleuth Encircled By Hens, which is of course a
  nod to chapter sixteen of Antarctic Death Paste, the second novel in the series.

  Tickets for the show are hard to get, and change hands for ridiculous prices on
  the OrrerySleuthBay website.

  Animal rights activists should note that none of the hens which appear in the musical
  is a real bird. Some of them are electronic robots, some are made of plasticine,
  and the ones nearest the front of the stage are constructs of sponge and wire and
  string.


  TWO MONKS

  Alfred Wesley Wishart''s phrase "two monks took the blood of a duck", which appears
  above in today''s quotation, was appropriated by the poet Dennis Beerpint as the
  title of a lengthy, as-yet-unpublished work. It may be that he is still writing
  it, but our regular Beerpint-watcher, Dan Sprawl, is currently in hospital with
  a case of jangling cav and pag, so news is limited.

  What we do know is that the prose-poem compares the image of monks draining blood
  from a duck with the concept of being "washed in the blood of the lamb". Here is
  an extract:

  Then Brother Fabrizius strangled another teal. "Hand me that retort, Brother Arpad,
  so that I may decant into it this teal''s gore." Brother Arpad reached for the retort
  and in so doing smashed an alembic. There was a sound of bells. The monks were called
  to compline. For each canonical hour they allocated a duck to be slaughtered for
  its blood. At compline, a teal. At matins, a merganser. At prime, a pintail. At
  tierce, a shoveler. At sext, a wigeon. At nones, a smew. And at vespers, a bufflehead.
  Out in the fields, sweet little lambs gambolled and frolicked. They would not frolic
  for long, for soon, in the monastery, it would be bathtime.


  TANIS DIENA

  Here is what to do. Get a pig''s head and place it on top of a stone. This will
  protect you from thunder and lightning. When you''ve done that, go to your nearest
  pig pen. Leaning on the fence, sing songs in celebration of the fertility of pigs.
  If you do not know any such songs, make one up. After lunch, bury the rest of the
  pig whose head is atop the stone, except for its feet. You will probably have eaten
  the head and the feet for lunch, with or without a garnish. Make sure you refrain
  from needlework all day, and don''t drink when you are at home. Keep an eye on the
  weather. If it is foggy, start gathering sandbags, for soon there will be floods.
  At all times bear in mind that you are in Ancient Latvia and that today is Tanis
  Diena, the sacred pig holiday.
