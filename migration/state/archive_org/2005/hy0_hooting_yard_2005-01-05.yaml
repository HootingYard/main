full_text: 'ME AND MY THORN-HOG

  I was given a common thorn-hog as a Christmas present. It is a wild pig, long-bodied
  and flat-sided, in colour much the hue of the mud in which it wallows, that mud
  being my front garden mud, which is somewhat darker than my back garden mud. The
  mud along the side of the house is another shade again, but Carnforth--that is the
  pig''s name--seems to prefer the front garden, or at least the mud in the front
  garden.

  I did not name her Carnforth. The benefactor who brought her to me at crack of dawn
  on Christmas morning told me she had been named before birth, like most thorn-hogs.
  The common practice, I was informed, is for these wild pigs to be called after iconic
  railway stations, and Carnforth is, of course, where Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard
  filmed Brief Encounter.

  In addition to telling me my new pig''s name, my benefactor gave me a little booklet
  titled So You''ve Been Given A Wild Pig?, which is packed with useful information
  on how to care for it, or I should say, her. Not that Carnforth needs much care.
  She spends most of her time wallowing in the mud in my front garden, and twice a
  day I unlock the gate to let her out so she can go rampaging about the hills, grunting
  furiously and waylaying anything edible. She is, after all, a wild pig.

  As she is fond of thorns, I took Carnforth to the garden centre when it opened for
  its Boxing Day sale, and we had a lovely time looking at the rosebushes. I think
  I can tell from her prolonged and noisy grunts that she would like to go back there
  when they have restocked.

  I have not yet allowed my thorn-hog into the house, as I am in the middle of redecorating.
  Sometimes in the middle of the night I can hear her thumping violently against the
  door trying to get in, but I want to finish her indoor sty first. Transforming the
  entire downstairs is going to be quite a job, but it will be such a nice surprise
  for her. The price of straw is high at the moment, so I may have to wait for the
  market to settle. Meanwhile, I am keeping an eagle eye on both hay and straw futures,
  and counting up all the loose change in my jars.

  I would write a thank you letter to my benefactor for such a delightful gift, but
  he did not leave a forwarding address. Indeed, after delivering the wild pig, he
  scampered away at high speed, shouting "Merry Christmas!" as if in the throes of
  a hysterical fit. And do you know something? I had never set eyes on him before.


  IN A CABIN, ON A SHIP

  In a cabin, on a ship, steaming into harbour, were two glum men. No. The ship was
  steaming away from the harbour, or port, a port whose name ended in -dam. Do not
  try to guess which port I refer to, for your brain will become dizened by the effort,
  and if you were an animation, little tweeting birds would circle around your head,
  such would be your befuddlement. I know whereof I speak, so trust me.

  This ship, now, the HMS Important And Grandiose Flying Many Flags, had gravitas,
  if we can ascribe gravitas to a ship, and as it steamed out of the port of -dam
  it had many, many flags flying. Some of the flags were blue, a cerulean blue like
  the best skies on the most gorgeous summer days. If you stare at the bright sky
  on such a day for long enough, you will see that the air is teeming with spirits,
  as multitudinous as flakes in a snowstorm, according to a French person called Leo
  Suavius. And look! Many of the flags flying from the ship, those that are blue and
  those of other shades, have pictures of angels on them. You may scan the flags as
  carefully as you wish, but you will not find a skull-and-crossbones hidden among
  them, for this is not a pirate ship.

  Is or was? I fear I have veered from the past tense to the present without explanation.
  Unless I am careful we shall hurtle into the future, and what is intended to be
  a sober piece of reportage will become science fiction, and you will toss it aside
  with a harrumph of displeasure, for if I know you well, dear reader, you would rather
  have me tell you of that which is prosaic and mundane than be titillated with intergalactic
  space rockets captained by alien beings called Thargon, zapping x-ray beams at inexplicable
  foes whose very geometry is unearthly.

  Once, when I had time to spare, and the ship was still in port, I tried to count
  all those magnificent flags and found that I could never arrive at an exact number.
  Perhaps there were sailors aboard hoisting and lowering them so rapidly that I did
  not see. I did not have a pair of binoculars in those days. Indeed, I still don''t,
  for what use would they be to a Cyclops like me, whose left eye was damaged during
  the Munich Air Disaster? I shall tell you about that another time.

  For now, picture that ship, with its serried blue flags and its innumerable angels,
  steaming out of -dam, and two glum men in a cabin below decks. The door is closed.
  The cabin has two portholes, and they are of frosted glass, for no particular reason.
  One of the gloomy men is sitting on an upper bunk, dangling his spindly legs over
  the side. When he used to laugh, years ago, he sounded like a bronchial horse, and
  indeed he suffered terribly from bronchitis and often, on his daily rounds, walked
  past a field in which a tremendous number of horses were put out to fallow, if that
  is the correct word. I don''t think it is, but I shall let it stand, I am in that
  kind of mood. But that was long ago. Now, glum and emaciated, he sits on the bunk
  in a cabin of the ship of many flags and clears his throat. He is about to introduce
  himself to the other miserable man in the cabin, who has just come in, slamming
  the door behind him.

  This second man is wearing atop his pulsating cranium a dippy hat. For the last
  few hours he has been thinking, thinking so damn hard, about ducks, for that is
  the sort of man he is. He wants to complete a catalogue of duck markings, duck behaviour
  and duck habitats, but has been unable to work on it for a while as he has sprained
  his wrist and cannot write. This accounts for his glumness, and also for his sling.
  The sprain occurred when he was trying to unscrew the jammed lid from a jar of hoodie-maroodie
  paste.

  We might ask, at this point, the cause of the other man''s gloom, the man on the
  bunk who used to laugh like a horse long, long ago. Sadly, his interior life is
  a thing of mystery, to me at any rate.

  From bulkhead to poop-hatch, instructions are being shouted back and forth by the
  ship''s crew. The mighty sun is gleaming bronze. Flags are flying and the sky is
  alive with auks and terns and guillemots. Below decks in the gloomy cabin, the two
  men reluctantly greet each other. This was the historic moment when Blodgett met
  Dobson.


  PHANTASMAL QUEST THING

  One of the more lamentable episodes in Dobson''s career was the year he wasted trying
  to write a Tolkeinish fantasy novel. What on earth got into him? It was the year
  Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba, that Alaska and Hawaii joined the United States, that
  Archbishop Makarios returned to Cyprus from exile; the year of a royal wedding in
  Belgium and of the so-called kitchen debate between Nikita Krushchev and Richard
  Milhous Nixon. It was the year which saw the debut of Rod Serling''s Twilight Zone,
  but also, in February, the day the music died. John McEnroe, Jens Stoltenberg, Max
  Decharne and Magic Johnson were born during that twelvemonth, while Frank Lloyd
  Wright, Mario Lanza, and Blind Willie McTell all perished.

  And all the while Dobson was holed up in a hut in some Arctic wasteland, writing
  something to which he gave the working title Phantasmal Quest Thing. It is anybody''s
  guess why he tried to write fantasy fiction. He had no feel for the genre. The reader
  will find here no elves, hobbits, or wizards--just fleas and flies. Dobson seemed
  to think he could build a thousand-page epic around a flea called Dave. The other
  characters--if such they can be called--have equally prosaic names. Instead of,
  say, Aragorn, Legolas and Gandalf we get Keith, Colin, Sue and Geoff. In place of
  adventures, we get these barely-anthropomorphised insects--accompanied by a few
  midges, ticks and bluebottles--flying and leaping around the place engaged in conversations
  which report on action sequences that are never themselves described.


  Tolkein : witless twaddle

  It is a soulless and tedious work, and it is best to draw a veil over Dobson''s
  habit, during that year, of dressing in cardigans and tweeds, hanging around in
  taverns drinking warm beer, and spouting politically reactionary drivel as a way
  of ingratiating himself with the fantasists he modelled himself upon. Let us just
  be thankful that Marigold Chew snapped him out of it. On the twelfth of October
  1959 she bundled him on to a boat, locked him in the cabin, and, through a coded
  system of knuckle-raps on the door, threatened him with a big fierce sword-wielding
  pneumatic robot dervish. It was a turning point in his career.


  DOCKING HACK

  Here is an old favourite, written over thirty years ago. Two words have been changed
  from the original version. I have no idea what it means, but it might be diverting
  to subject it to piercing critical analysis. Does anybody want to have a go?

  Hats are off in Docking; caps are being doffed. The council''s got a town plan.
  The maths are on a chart. Pips have been spat out and drudgery is bye-byed. Chocolate
  puddings seem to be in everybody''s pantry. And here comes Pebblehead pere. He caught
  a shark in waters. His sou''wester''s been askew since 1954-ish. Bubbles surge from
  froth. The chemist''s shop is shut. There''s pills & pills & pills that no Docking
  man could swallow. Suffering aborted. The council in a caucus. The shaven heads
  of heads of state are battering the doors down. The city gates, the turrets, the
  alleys, roads & mews: Docking has its ears all go for red alert decisions. Language
  has been no-no''d, the bamboo men are wailing, the breakage rate is scheduled: the
  system has been broken. Crayons pink & stacked, the burnt sienna packaged. Vandals
  clash at nightfall, but Docking has its crackers. Plastic wrapped in plastic. The
  Docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar, a gorgeous snag-tooth babble. Prepared
  to dance a hoo-cha, not a tear or boo-hoo. Thousands of museums stacked with golden
  maps. Misshapen trunk road closures. Big stone reconstructions. Docking''s cottoned
  on: it''s a town about a tower. The frame is out of kilter, the coughing''s filling
  coffins. Oh, but I want to go back to that Docking, Docking hack.


  BELSHAZZAR''S FEAST


  "Will you come with me to Belshazzar''s feast?" asked Agnetha.

  "I didn''t know you''d been invited. I''ll have to ask Bjorn," said Benny.

  Benny strode off into the mountains to find Bjorn. Agnetha stayed at the hotel,
  sipping her alcohol-free absinthe. Wild winds were howling and storm clouds gathered.

  Benny found Bjorn sheltering in a declivity. He was burning charcoal.

  "Agnetha wants me to go with her to Belshazzar''s feast," said Benny, after tipping
  his hat to Bjorn in greeting, "What do you think?"

  "The gods may throw a dice," said Bjorn, "Their minds as cold as ice." He stared
  off into the mist-enshrouded distance, towards the fireworks factory and the abandoned
  tennis courts.

  "I shall reflect on what you have said and come to a decision, then," said Benny,
  "Thank you."

  On the way back to the hotel, Benny was accosted on the mountain path by Anni-Frid.
  She was dressed like a gaucho and looked as if she had been weeping.

  "Anni-Frid, whatever is the matter?" asked Benny.

  Anni-Frid dabbed at her tears with a paper napkin from the hotel. Her upper lip
  curled in a sneer. Discomfited by her silence, Benny began to gabble.

  "Agnetha asked me to accompany her to Belshazzar''s feast," he said, "And I asked
  Bjorn for his advice. He is up there in a declivity burning charcoal."

  "Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin," said Anni-Frid, and she pranced away into the mist.


  HENGIST POD ASKS A QUESTION

  Now here is a question worth asking. Did there once exist, aeons ago, on a distant,
  icy planet, a race of beings not unlike emperor penguins in appearance, if not size,
  for let us say that these beings were minuscule, that a hundred of them gathered
  together would be no bigger than a gnat, and that these beings were unfathomably
  stupid, that their behaviour patterns were inane and pointless, but that they somehow
  managed to construct an intergalactic spacecraft built from pack ice, and used it
  to ferry themselves to other planets and other galaxies for no purpose other than
  what we might call sight-seeing, and that over millions of years they visited thousands
  of planets without ever once alighting on earth, for the pale blue dot of our planet,
  to use Carl Sagan''s phrase, was visually horrifying to these beings, whose eight
  eyes could not tolerate the colour blue, in any of its tints and shades, or green,
  for that matter, given that their own planet bathed in a totally alien colour spectrum
  unimaginable to the human brain, unimaginable even to someone like self-styled brain
  guru and MindMap(tm) maker Tony Buzan, and that one of these beings, wearing a sort
  of rocket booster backpack, jetted out of the spacecraft when it was near earth,
  and this tiny emperor penguin-like being collided with an asteroid and was pulled
  into earth''s magnetic field, if that is possible, and it came in to land on the
  towpath of the canal just outside my door, last Wednesday, when I was on my way
  to buy a rake and a hoe for my allotment, having counted my potatoes as I liked
  to do every morning, wearing a plastic Viking helmet with only one horn, the other
  horn having broken off when I was clambering down the hillside without pausing for
  breath on that day I was pursued by an ill-tempered giant badger whose sett I had
  accidentally demolished? Answer me that, and I will give you sixpence.

  "CORNELIUS GEMMA, LIB. 2. DE NAT. MIRAC...."

  "Cornelius Gemma, lib. 2. de nat. mirac. c. 4. relates of a young maid, called Katherine
  Gualter, a cooper''s daughter, an. 1571. that had such strange passions and convulsions,
  three men could not sometimes hold her; she purged a live eel, which he saw, a foot
  and a half long, and touched it himself; but the eel afterwards vanished; she vomited
  some twenty-four pounds of fulsome stuff of all colours, twice a day for fourteen
  days; and after that she voided great balls of hair, pieces of wood, pigeon''s dung,
  parchment, goose dung, coals; and after them two pounds of pure blood, and then
  again coals and stones, on which some had inscriptions bigger than a walnut, some
  of them pieces of glass, brass, &c. besides paroxysms of laughing, weeping and ecstasies,
  &c. Et hoc (inquit) cum horore vidi, this I saw with horror." -- Robert Burton,
  The Anatomy Of Melancholy...

  ... the greatest book in the English language, from which I could quote endlessly,
  did I not have a one-quotation-per-writer policy for the Hooting Yard quote of the
  day. Arbitrary and senseless, I know, but therein lies part of this site''s charm.


  HAS HE TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS SENSES?

  No evildoer was safe when Special Agent Rastus Blot was on the case. Never in the
  annals of crime and its detection has there been a more successful operative. Not
  for Blot the ratiocinative methods of Sherlock Holmes or Prince Zaleski, nor the
  pathologically violent approach of Spillane''s Mike Hammer. Whether the dread deed
  was a polite country house murder or a lowlife robbery, Blot had a singular advantage
  over his rivals. Let us watch him at work, and then, children, I shall quiz you
  to see if you can spot the wellspring of his genius.

  The crime : a bloated janitor is found done to death in the locked boiler room of
  the Pang Hill Spangle Factory. His recent behaviour had been irksome.

  The clues : anomalous items discovered in the vicinity include an old Wishbone Ash
  LP, minus its sleeve; a defaced railway timetable showing signs of having been gnawed
  by a hamster or a vole; the bones of an osprey, picked clean; a photographic still
  of Gary Cooper as Howard Roark in the film of Ayn Rand''s The Fountainhead; and
  a reduced-price jar of sump oil. Witness statements indicate that during the previous
  night a series of banshee-like caterwaulings could be heard, coming from o''er yonder
  in the direction of the Place of Flapping and Rumpus up in the sinister hills.

  The suspects : nobody.


  Agent Blot was called in after the police drew a blank. Greasy hair plastered flat
  on his head, his eyes milky with some hideous optical disease, and short of breath,
  Blot demanded a slap-up dinner consisting almost entirely of recovered meat products.
  He bought copies of all the local newspapers, investigated a slab of masonry, took
  photographs of bees, wasps, and hornets, and devoted three days to cutting a slot
  into a cardboard tube using a pair of scissors and a nail file. Dust gathered on
  his epaulettes and he made no attempt to brush it off. He went angling in brackish
  streams, accompanied by a slovenly farmer''s wife and her slovenly dog. Easter was
  approaching. Blot had a number of prolonged fits, but whether they were genuine
  or feigned was open to question, not least by the sheriff, a giant bear of a man
  whose beard was used as a floor mop. On the Saturday, eighteen townsfolk were arrested,
  charged with the murder of the bloated janitor, and hanged from gibbets in Midge
  Ure Square, where their corpses were pecked at by crows.

  THE CABINET OF DOCTOR CALICAGCAG

  It was a stormy and hideous night. A ferocious gale uprooted sycamores, hollyhocks,
  and strange unearthly shrubs which grow only in Finland. Thunderclaps deafened the
  major domo of the orphanage. Lightning bolts blinded the crapulous Stalinist funeral
  director. Then came the rain, a torrential downpour unleashed by storm-clouds blacker
  than the blackest thing the human mind can comprehend. The temperature plummeted.
  Rain turned to hail, assailing with ten thousand merciless pin-pricks the pathetic
  figure of a man trudging through the streets of Helsinki dressed only in shirt-sleeves
  and boxer shorts. The man was the notorious forger, quack and charlatan Inigo Hoist.
  Moments before, he had been denuded of the rest of his clothing and ejected from
  the hovel of his concubine, who had taken exception to the odour on his breath of
  sour custard and hibiscus. Hoist managed to reach his doctor''s surgery without
  being crushed by a felled sycamore. He hammered on the door, wailing desperately.
  At long last Doctor Calicagcag drew back the fourteen bolts on his door and let
  Hoist in. The good doctor was wearing a rhinoceros mask of beaten bronze. He cackled,
  and shoved the snivelling Hoist into his sinister cabinet. Then he began to adjust
  the dials on the control panel......
