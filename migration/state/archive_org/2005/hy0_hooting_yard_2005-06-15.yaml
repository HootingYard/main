full_text: 'THE STORY OF THE LAME DOG, THE CAGED BIRD, THE DROWNED CAT, THE GOLD WATCH,
  THE WHISKY BOY AND THE INSANE BOY

  Once upon a time, there was an insane boy who could only be becalmed by listening
  to prog rock.

  On Monday, a Barclay James Harvest album was played to him.

  On Tuesday, there was a power cut, and in his mania the insane boy went out and
  attacked a lame dog. The dog''s name was Hoo-Boo-Goo. It was a winter ghost dog.

  On Wednesday, electricity was restored and the insane boy listened over and over
  again to Pantagruel''s Nativity by Gentle Giant.

  On Thursday the insane boy absconded from his deep dark dank cellar and headed for
  the hills. With one swift inhuman movement he plucked a starling from the sky and
  put it in a birdcage.

  On Friday his keepers forced the insane boy to listen to Atomic Rooster at an almost
  imperceptible volume.

  On Saturday the insane boy took advantage of a moment''s inattention on the part
  of his guards to drown a cat in a puddle. The cat was called Fad-Fod-Flap and it
  was fourteen years old.

  On Sunday Carl Palmer of Emerson Lake And Palmer visited the insane boy and played
  a drum solo that lasted all day.

  On Monday the insane boy smashed a gold watch into a thousand bits with his terrifyingly
  pale fists.

  On Tuesday the insane boy had an iPod with only one track clamped to his head. The
  song was A Plague Of Lighthouse Keepers by Van Der Graaf Generator.

  On Wednesday the insane boy managed to smuggle a bottle of spirits into his filthy
  cell. The warders wrote a report for Captain Jarvis in which they called the insane
  boy "the whisky boy", inaccurately, as the bottle contained turps.

  On Thursday the insane boy begged to hear Tales Of Topographic Oceans by Yes.

  On Friday he was pronounced incurable.

  That story was in words of more than one syllable. It has no moral.


  THE TAXONOMY OF DUCKS, SWANS AND GEESE IS IN A STATE OF FLUX

  Captain Baxter made one last, desperate attempt to adjust the hooters, knobs and
  boosters on the console.

  "For god''s sake, man, the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese is in a state of flux!"
  he screamed. But it was too late...

  Ten days earlier, it had all seemed so simple. Baxter had been summoned to the Admiralty
  on a hot Tuesday morning. The place was swarming with admirals, but by asking a
  series of increasingly astute questions, he tracked down the admiral he had come
  to see. Righteous Rank Admiral O''Houlihan was a forlorn and tawdry man, and Baxter
  found him lurking in a corner of his office where light never penetrated. He hissed
  at the captain to join him there.

  "I''m glad you could come, Baxter. For months now I''ve been getting intelligence
  reports about a certain matter that, I don''t mind telling you, has frozen the blood
  in my veins. That is why I skulk in corners." He shuddered. "I skulk, and as you
  can see, I shudder. You would, too, Baxter, if you knew what I know about a certain
  matter. And know you shall, soon enough. I''m sending you on a mission."

  Baxter''s nose began to bleed, but he staunched it with a large rectangular pad
  of cotton wool.

  "It''s lucky for you that I am not a vampire," said the Admiral, mysteriously. His
  suit was cheap, his ears great prominent flaps the colour of death, his shoes had
  been gnawed at by weasels, and he lacked backbone. That was why he needed Baxter.
  Baxter''s backbone was the talk of the Admiralty, not just canteen gossip but the
  subject of secret memoranda, bulging dossiers, and meetings attended by every single
  admiral in the building, all crammed into O''Houlihan''s sunless refuge, jostling
  for space. Baxter knew nothing of this. He knew a lot about ships, rigging, cables,
  hawsers, decks both poop and orlop, dinghies, oars, the thews into which oars are
  slotted, and many other topics of maritime significance. His diet consisted chiefly
  of seaweed and ship''s biscuits. Until today.

  Admiral O''Houlihan reached into the darkness which engulfed this corner of the
  room, and Baxter heard cranking noises.

  "Before you attend to a certain matter, Baxter, we must have lunch," he said, trying
  unsuccessfully to disguise his forlornness. His stick-thin arms set to work winching
  up a crate of food from a pantry far, far below. Baxter offered to help, but the
  Admiral was a proud man in spite of his tawdriness. At long last he was able to
  haul the crate into the room.

  "We shall eat here, in the shadows," he announced, and began unloading the food.
  The pair of them tucked into a feast of baps, buns, eggs, fat, jam, pie, beans,
  cake, chops, curd, flan, kale, pork, rice, rolls, rusks, sago, soup, suet, tarts,
  bacon, bread, broth, cloves, cream, dough, flour, fudge, gravy, gruel, honey, icing,
  jelly, liver, mince, prunes, pulses, salad, scones, syrup, toast, wafers, yeast,
  batter, bonbons, butter, cheese, comfits, eclairs, faggots, garlic, greens, junket,
  kidneys, mousse, noodles, nougat, oxtails, pastry, peppers, potatoes, ragout, raisins,
  simnel, sorbet, sponge, toffee, walnuts and peppermint, at the end of which Baxter
  was given full details of his mission. It would be no easy task, but he kissed the
  Admiral''s forehead as a sign that he accepted it.

  O''Houlihan wedged himself even further into the corner as Baxter took his leave,
  striding across the filthy office and placing his blood-soaked rectangular pad of
  cotton wool into a basket before closing the door gently behind him. Little did
  either of them know that in ten days time the taxonomy of ducks, swans and geese
  would be in a state of flux, and Baxter would face a peril greater than death itself!


  THOSE GUBERNATORIAL BELLS

  O how they clanged, those gubernatorial bells! It is eighty years now since their
  peals sounded, but still I hear them in my head. They clanged ceaselessly, all day
  and all night, deafeningly loud, for years on end. Cows stood dazed in the fields
  around the bell-tower, many, many cows, too many cows to count, all dazed and stunned,
  and in those days no cowherds came to give them succour.

  In your tongue, "gubernatorial" refers to governorship, but in my land at that time
  the gubernatorial bells were the ever-clanging bells of the ferocious tyrant known
  variously as the Gub or Guber or Gubernat. Some said the Gub was a fiend in human
  form, but none had ever seen it, so how could they be so sure, muttering darkly
  in the corner of the tavern, professing a knowledge they did not have, rewarded
  with a refilled tankard by some credulous foreign person on an ill-advised visit
  to our bell-blasted village?

  Dobson came here once. He crashed through the tavern doors, a clumsy adventurer--for
  he was young then--and jabbered at anyone who would listen that he wanted to go
  up the hill to the castle, to meet the Gubernat face to face.

  "And what do you think you''ll find?" sneered an old frogman in the last stages
  of drunken despair. Within seconds he keeled off his stool and lay insensible in
  the sawdust. Dobson answered him regardless.

  "I know not what I shall find, old man," he announced, "I know only that if those
  benighted bells are ever to stop clanging, the Gubernat must be dragged from its
  perch in the castle atop the hill. Then you will know peace, as will the countless
  cows in your pretty fields, who now are dazed and stunned."

  "Our fields are indeed pretty," muttered someone lurking in the gloom, "As is your
  speech, young Dobson. But the Gub will never allow you into its presence. The last
  swashbuckling foreign person who came here on a mission such as yours ran away gibbering
  along Hollyhock Lane. They recovered his corpse from the duckpond a week later.
  When our Necropod Woman made her examination, do you know what she found? His brain
  had been sucked out into space!"

  There is an art to saying "Pshaw!" with conviction. Later in life, as you know,
  Dobson was one of the great pshawers, but back then he was callow and shallow, and
  the "pshaw" he pshawed was a pitiful pip on his lips. In truth, he was unnerved
  by this news. He resolved to obtain a letter of introduction from the Gubernat''s
  solicitors, Buttercups and Tod, whose office he had passed on his way from the railway
  station. He pranced out of the tavern and retraced his steps.

  Neither Buttercups nor Tod was available, he learned. Cow business kept them fully
  occupied, for there were numberless cows and only the pair of them, the one greasy,
  the other mute. Dobson sat on a lump of stone in the market square, biting his fingernails
  and praying for the insane clanging of the gubernatorial bells to stop. That is
  how I found him, so many years ago, on that gorgeous day when first we met, when
  still the cowherds shunned the cows, when the bells still clanged, in that village
  far away, where I plied my trade as the Necropod Woman, fruitlessly searching for
  brains sucked into space, and for a pamphleteer whose pamphlets were not yet written,
  not yet read.


  TITANS OF THE SILVER SCREEN

  The assassination of an important world figure is so shocking that other events
  of the day, including other deaths, get overlooked. A notable example is the death
  of Aldous Huxley on 22nd November 1963. That day, of course, is recalled because
  of what happened near the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. The demise
  of the astonishingly tall, severely myopic writer went virtually unremarked (as,
  incidentally, did the fact that only a few weeks before, the vacuum cleaner salesman
  who knocked on the door of Huxley''s Los Angeles home was the young Don Van Vliet,
  soon to become known to the world as Captain Beefheart. Never let it be said that
  Hooting Yard is stinting with the facts.)

  There was another death that day that received even less attention, despite the
  fact that the cinema was robbed of one of its most titanic talents. Few today remember
  Walt Dinsey, overshadowed in death by Kennedy and Huxley, and in posterity by his
  near-namesake, a weird sociopath given to the production of sentimental pap.

  In his centenary year, it is only fitting that we should recall some of Dinsey''s
  greatest triumphs. Over the next few months, our team of film buffs, led by Fatima
  Gilliblat, will be looking at each of Dinsey''s masterpieces in turn. Fatima is
  currently out of the country... sorry, out in the country, eschewing her usual urban
  haunts for a summer spent mooching about in some godforsaken abandoned farmyard.
  She found time, however, to send this brief note:

  Hello readers! Fatima Gilliblat here, sprawled on a musty hay bale and thinking
  about Thomas Hardy, Fate, Destiny, and the grunting of pigs at dawn. But I haven''t
  forgotten my promise to write about the films of Walt Dinsey, and I''m putting the
  finishing touches to a sprightly little essay on that timeless classic Beauty And
  the Bees. In my opinion it is the finest killer bee attack film ever made, and I
  hope to communicate my overenthusiasm to you very, very soon. Heigh ho, green grow
  the rushes-oh.

  KILLER BEES : THE MYSTERY SOLVED

  See how we move so easily from birds to bees? Some people think that Hooting Yard
  is compiled in some vague and random fashion, the ordering of items being based
  on whatever springs into Frank''s pea-sized but pulsating brain from moment to moment.
  Ha! If only it were that simple. So abstruse is the underlying system, rumours are
  flying about that Dan Brown''s next billion-selling blockbuster could well be The
  Hooting Yard Code, in which connections, patterns, and inexplicably deep twaddle
  are to be found between this website, the legend of Prester John, Atlantis, the
  moon landings, Blunkettgate, and Rosicrucianism. It is all there, if only you know
  where to look.

  Where was I? Bees. Killer bees, to be precise. Pansy Cradledew, who is tirelessly
  enthusiastic about researching such matters, has stumbled upon the solution to the
  mystery of killer bee attacks. She was reading that tremendous book, the original
  Chambers'' Book Of Days, which has been lauded here before, and came upon this:


  "It has been shewn in a contemporary publication, that it is customary in many parts
  of England, when a death takes place, to go and formally impart the fact to the
  bees, to ask them to the funeral, and to fix a piece of crape upon their hives;
  thus treating these insects as beings possessed of something like human intelligence,
  and therefore entitled to all the respect which one member of a family pays to the
  rest. Not long before penning these notes, I met with an instance of this feeling
  about bees. A neighbour of mine had bought a hive of bees at an auction of the goods
  of a farmer who had recently died. The bees seemed very sickly, and not likely to
  thrive, when my neighbour''s servant bethought him that they had never been put
  in mourning for their late master; on this he got a piece of crape and tied it to
  a stick, which he fastened to the hive. After this the bees recovered, and when
  I saw them they were in a very flourishing state--a result which was unhesitatingly
  attributed to their having been put into mourning."


  Pansy sees here the key to the antisocial behaviour of killer bees. Unlike what
  happened with the lucky hives in the quoted passage, most bereaved families in this
  day and age forget to include bees in the mourning process. If you doubt that, try
  to recall the last time you saw a grief-stricken relict tying a piece of crape to
  a stick and attaching it to a beehive. As this sensible practice has died out, so
  millions of bees, deprived of the opportunity to mourn their human pals, are thrown
  into dangerous neurotic confusion. Bereft, ignored, and not even given a piece of
  crape on a stick, let alone counselling, they are unable to achieve closure and
  thus band together into swarms of homicidal buzzing frenzy, with predictable--and
  catastrophic--results.

  Pansy will be presenting evidence to a joint panel of experts on funeral arrangements,
  bereavement, and bees in the near future.


  A BAG ON YOUR FOOT

  Wearing a bag on your foot is an effective way of stopping water leaking into your
  boot. Such a disaster can occur when the sole of your boot is pitted with holes
  and you step inadvertently into a puddle of rainwater which has fallen out of the
  sky. The sole of your boot may be so pitted because it is old and worn, or it may
  be that the holes appeared all together, of a sudden, for example if your boot came
  into contact with an industrial hole-punch. Whatever the cause of the holes in the
  sole of your boot, which will allow water to seep into your sock, you will be very
  careful to watch out for puddles of rainwater, and other watery dangers, such as
  duckponds and the sea. But I would argue that it is a near certainty your vigilance
  will not be so acute as to withstand the unexpected. You may be hailed by an acquaintance
  aboard a passing bus with a top deck open to the elements. A klaxon may sound. You
  may be temporarily blinded by a mysterious hovering ball of incandescent light.
  In these hypothetical cases, and numerous others, your holed boot may splash into
  a body of water and your sock will become drenched, as will your foot, as likely
  as not, for it is rare for a sock to be watertight in this country.


  That is why a bag worn on your foot, over your boot of course, can be such a boon.
  A judiciously chosen bag will stop water entering the holes in the sole of your
  boot and soaking into your sock, making your foot wet. We all know what happened
  to those poor terrified soldiers cowering in trenches during the Great War. Let
  us take precautions not available to them. Remember, they did not have plastic bags.

  You will have noticed the words "judiciously chosen" in the second sentence of the
  previous paragraph. I inserted them when preparing the final draft of this text,
  when it struck me with tremendous force that to say merely "a bag will stop water
  entering the holes in the sole of your boot and soaking into your sock, making your
  foot wet" was a laughably inadequate prescription. I did not actually laugh, but
  I thumped my forehead with the flat of my hand and groaned at my inexactitude.


  Selecting the bag to wear on your foot is not onerous. You just have to ensure that
  it is a bag which will be impervious to water, hence the reference to plastic bags.
  Think polythene, or even rubber. It is tempting to advise you against using a paper
  bag, but you already know that a paper bag would be useless for our present purposes.
  If you do not know that using a paper bag will leave you with a leaking boot and
  a soaked sock and foot, you are either too young to be reading this or you have
  an almost inconceivable lack of common sense, like Tim, who put a paper bag on his
  boot when he dangled his foot into a paddling pool.

  It is for Tim, and those like Tim, that this article has been written. When you
  meet Tim, and see at a glance that he has only one leg, you will understand why
  throughout I have referred to the boot and the sock and the foot in the singular.
  If you are a biped, you can still reap the benefits of my thoughtful advice by making
  the necessary adjustments to the text in your head. I am in no mood to repeat the
  whole thing again, ever, even if flooding becomes widespread in these dismal fens
  where we live out our dismal lives under a dismal sky that threatens rain again
  today.



  CLOT

  Ferenc Puskas, who shared his name with the legendary Hungarian footballer, was
  a beefy clot of a man. Unlike his namesake, he never played for Honved. He never
  played football at all. Gas was what fascinated him, to the point of ruin. Gas and
  eels.


  The other Ferenc Puskas

  In his lecture What Philately Teaches, John N Luff reminds us that "the connection
  between cows and postage stamps is not obvious" and the same may be said of eels
  and gas, of gas and eels. Within Ferenc''s teeming skull, however, the two could
  not be disentangled. Beefy clot he may have been, but he had an extraordinary ability
  to see linkages between things of which most of us are oblivious.

  There is a story about him, that he once gassed an eel, but it has been proved to
  be untrue. And how could it be true? We are dealing with a man who spoke to eels,
  communed with them, in a way little understood even now, half a century after his
  death. Because he salivated at four times the normal rate, Puskas'' speaking voice
  was difficult to decipher, and he did not help matters by forever sucking on gobstoppers,
  even in his sleep. That is why the transcript of his one radio interview, conducted
  in his harbour hut in 1931, is so patchy. Acute and erudite questions pour forth,
  but of his replies only a few words are intelligible, punctuated by infuriating
  ellipses, hundreds of them, more ellipses than one is ever likely to find in any
  other single text since the invention of the alphabet. (That may sound like hyperbole,
  and maybe it is, but I know what I am talking about. See my Compendium Of Elliptical
  Phrases In World Literature From The Dawn Of Time To The Present Day if you doubt
  me.)

  So, for example, we get this:

  Interviewer : Mr Puskas, it has been said that you communicate with eels, and that
  the subject of most of your discussions with them is gas. You claim that most of
  your knowledge of gas comes from what eels tell you. As a beefy clot, you have an
  air of saintly innocence which makes it unlikely that you are lying. Could it be
  that you are deluded?

  Puskas : ... stoop ... bag ... hat ... fop ... glue ... pot ... gunk ...

  Inarticulate lump he may have been, but we cannot simply dismiss Ferenc Puskas.
  As long as there are men and women on this planet who care about gas and eels, his
  name will live on, a beacon in the darkness, shining brightly, then sputtering,
  fading, until it is finally extinguished, and all is ruin.'
