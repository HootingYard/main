full_text: 'MY LITTLE BLIND CROW

  So there I was, kneading dough, thinking about Edgar Allan Poe, and my heart fit
  to burst about my little blind crow. The moon was full and it cast a glow. Santa
  in the chimney said "Ho ho ho". I wept hot tears for my little blind crow. The wind
  doth howl, the gale doth blow. They used to call Stalin "Uncle Joe", but Stalin
  never sobbed all night for my little blind crow. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
  Brother, can you spare a dime? Sister, are you too crumpled with woe when you think
  about my little blind crow? They say that Stalin''s five-year plans made Russia
  strong. But that has nothing to do with my song. I want it set to music by Status
  Quo. A sad, sad song for my little blind crow.


  THE WINDOWS IN THE VILLA

  ...the wind in the willows, the wind in the windows, the will in the windows, the
  wills in the window, Goop, the executor, saw that the will had been lodged in the
  casement window, it was hidden behind the curtain, although he was not certain,
  the will in the window, the lady in the lake, the lake like the lady, the lake in
  the la di da, the break in the lake, the Beak Keepsake, for a keepsake, in her locket,
  the lady in the lake kept a beak, the beak of a bird, the third bird, the first
  bird was a chaffinch, the second was a vulture, the third bird was dead, its beak
  had been detached and she kept it as a keepsake in her locket in her pocket, the
  quick and the dead, the dead and the sick, the sick and the sad, the sick man was
  sad, he wrote his will, he plighted his troth, he was as sick as a dog, he was sick
  in the trough, the tooth of the truth, those shoes of his, his shoes, the truth
  of boots and shoes, a boot is a shoe, the beauty of boots, the mutiny on the Bounty,
  a bountiful feast, the test of the best, deceit is a crime, the crime of the tooth,
  the truth of the crime, in Much Hadham, is that true? I''ve not checked, the check
  and the stripe, the striped and the hooped, the patterned and plain, the brain drain,
  the drain at the kerb, the kerb of the path, the path of life, the death of earth,
  the dearth of crime, the crime of passion, the scarlet pimpernel, the pimpled and
  sick, the sickness unto death, rude health, untold wealth, pelf, filthy lucre, Lord
  Lucan, the Charge of the Light Brigade, the raid of the brigade, the raid was made,
  the maid was late, the tale was told, as bold as brass, the caste system, a Shropshire
  Lad, baize, the toll of bells, the bells of hell, Beelzebub''s bells, that swelling
  brogue, that broken shell, a-wassailing we will go...


  MUSEOLOGY

  The Tantarabim Carton was recovered from an old potting shed by Dobson, during one
  of his forays into what he called anarcho-''patapsychoarchaeolontology. It is a
  ceremonial carton which was used for unknown purposes during ceremonies prosecuted
  by the Bleach-Splattered Tantarabim Priesthood. Grim and horrifying these rituals
  may have been, but not the carton. It is 45 cm. in height, has a jewel-encrusted
  crimplene base, ivory fluting, ruched silk underbelts, hectic trimmings, a delightful
  milky-green ribbed spandole, villainous scraping marks, a gutta percha rim, opalescent
  bison-head motifs, swivelling glutinous beads inlaid with serried gems, fleur-de-lys
  hatching, precise web-and-tuck dufraiment, talc stipples, a riband nightside opening
  on the velveteen casing, some rather brusque kaolin relief work, tiny cack-iron
  clips, berry lagging, a splendid gilt Spode handle, and corky frets on the oversling.
  No picture is available.

  Dobson tried to present his find to an art gallery somewhere on the hard, unyielding
  banks of a river in Yukon Country, but he was chased away by burly men with bludgeons,
  and was lucky to escape with his life. He subsequently wrote up the episode in his
  pamphlet Chucklesome Fripperies From My Notebooks (Lavender Series).


  CHRONONHOTONTHOLOGOS

  For many years I believed that the most startling opening line in theatre was Ubu''s
  "Merdre!" in Alfred Jarry''s Ubu Roi. But no! What could better this:

  Aldiborontiphoscophornio! Where left you Chrononhotonthologos?

  These are the opening words of Henry Carey''s Chrononhotonthologos, spoken by Rigdum-Funnidos.
  The play is not unlike Ubu Roi, in that the title character is a greedy, bad-tempered
  and violent king. (It would have been a great role for Robert Coates.) The final
  scene leaves the stage littered with corpses--this memorable line will give you
  some idea:

  O horrid! horrible, and horridest horror! Our king! our general! our cook! our doctor!
  All dead! stone dead! irrevocably dead! O-----h!---- [All groan, a tragedy groan.]

  The play also includes my favourite musical direction, which would not be out of
  place at the Festival of Argumentative Music at Ulm (see 24th February):

  SCENE--A Bed Chamber. Chrononhotonthologos asleep. [Rough music, Viz. Salt Boxes
  and Rolling Pins, Grid-Irons and Tongs, Sow-Gelders Horns, Marrow-Bones and Cleavers,
  c. c.] He wakes.

  Henry Carey (c.1687-1743) also wrote, among much else, the words to God Save The
  King (or Queen). Chrononhotonthologos was so popular in its day that the title entered
  the language, as a synonym for "furious, violent, demanding, self-centered" (sounds
  just like Pa Ubu) and appeared in earlier editions of Roget''s Thesaurus, although
  appears not to have made it into the OED.

  You can read the play in full by clicking on the picture of Pa Ubu (for want of
  a picture of Chrononhotonthologos himself).



  HOON HING BOOM BANG A BANG

  Tap tap tap. Clunk. Tippety tippety tap tap tap. Clunk. Oh. Hoon Hing Boom Bang
  A Bang. A pudding-basin haircut on the Choctaw man. A goat in distress in a faraway
  place. Pins and needles and rigorous thought. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.

  When you fall from a tree you''ve been climbing, and your headache is thumping thump
  thump, and a pig has a snout and a tail, and there''s leakage and victims and loss,
  how are you going to decide the right time to set fire to everything that has to
  be set fire to? Food and shelter and clothing, thousands of seaside resorts, Celine
  Dion''s autograph, Lake Winnipeg, and that pudding-basin haircut on the Choctaw
  Man, his father''s gaze and his mother''s tongue, his brother''s axe and his sister''s
  stick, his daughter''s bell and his other daughter''s bell as well, both the bells,
  chiming away. Oh. Hoon Hing. Tap tap tap. Hoon Hing. Clunk. Tap tap tap. Clunk.
  Clunk. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.

  I went to Oswestry and I went to Dawlish. I took my library books back. Gigantic
  screeching vultures scraped across the sky, and the sky was blue, and the library
  sat on a hill near a lake, that legendary drained lake, where they found the big
  white bones of something that they did not know had ever lived. They drew around
  the bones with chalk and then they took the bones away. They were big and white
  and boxed in crates and tap tap tap, tippety tap, clunk. Clunk.

  Hey there, lantern-jawed rag-wrapped florist. Have you seen these strands of floss?
  The Choctaw Man had some for supper, and now he''s writhing in that ditch. He used
  to be a narcoleptic, then he joined the river police. Now he''s writhing in a ditch
  because he ate those strands of floss. Hoon Hing. Hoon Hing.

  Dark and cumbersome. Love in a mist. An orphan''s shattered view of a hedge. The
  necessity for each of the crew to bale when asked. Here''s your bucket, here''s
  your pail. With U Thant In Kamchatka, an anthology by Several Hands. All those widows
  lurking in doorways slicing up cabbage and shelling peas. I was in the snow with
  a horse and a pillow, and I lavished attention on things unseen. Tap. Clunk.

  Disco jam bag hellpit frock coat. Breakfast jar pot bandage king. That was me in
  all my glory. Tap. Clunk. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.


  THE GLASS MAN

  "The Glass Man came in a variety of forms. He might be a urinal, an oil lamp or
  other glass receptacle, or else he might himself be trapped within a glass bottle...
  [There is] a sudden plethora of literary Glass Men. One of these is Cervantes''
  Glass Licentiate, TomA s Rodaja. Obsessed with the idea that he is made of glass,
  and traumatized by any physical contact, he refuses to wear shoes or any restrictive
  clothing. He eats only fruit offered to him in a urinal-pouch (vasera de orinal)
  on the end of a stick, and drinks fresh water with his hands. He sleeps outdoors
  or huddled in some hayloft, takes refuge in the country during a storm, and walks
  in the middle of the street to avoid injury from falling roof tiles."

  From An odd kind of melancholy: reflections on the glass delusion in Europe (1440-1680)
  by Gill Speak

  The invaluable Fed By Birds provides a link to the article, which is Mr Key''s  recommended
  reading for today. I left a comment on the post saying that I was sure there was
  a quotation buried in the 2003-2006 Hooting Yard Archives about a delusionist who
  believed his legs were made of glass. And voila!, here it is:

  "The other case, as related by Van Swieten, in his commentaries upon Boerhaave,
  is that of a learned man, who had studied, till be fancied his legs to be of glass:
  in consequence of which he durst not attempt to stir, but was constantly under anxiety
  about them. His maid bringing one day some wood to the fire, threw it carelessly
  down; and was severely reprimanded by her master, who was terrified not a little
  for his legs of glass. The surly wench, out of all patience with his megrims, as
  she called them, gave him a blow with a log upon the parts affected; which so enraged
  him, that he instantly rose up, and from that moment recovered the use of his legs."--Anon
  ("An Oxonian"), Thaumaturgia, Or Elucidations Of The Marvellous (1835).


  TODAY''S RECIPE

  Ingredients : 6 oz self-raising flour, 6 oz self-hatred flour, 4 tbsp Jezebel oil,
  25 pints boiled duckpond water, 1 raisin, 12 quail''s eggs, a smidgeon of marzipan,
  12 cucumbers, 13 sticks rhubarb, a very large hollyhock, 2 buckets chaff, 1 pint
  turtle''s blood, 5 pkts Special K(r), 15 blood oranges, 2 fresh bream*, 54 more
  raisins, 1 plastic bag, 8 radishes, 1 cup ble, 18 pints milk, 3 lb toffee, 5 tbsp
  gum arabic, 2 cups Bathsheba extract, 62 moorhen feathers, dash of isinglass, 1
  tbsp lemon curd, 3 balls wool, 5 oz. titanium, 1 beetle, 8 jars nameless, eldritch
  plasma.

  Method : 1. Find a large metal drum, about the size of a telephone kiosk. 2. Shove
  everything into it, having chopped up the things that need chopping. 3. Boil. 4.
  While it boils, think long and hard about the fact that rhubarb takes its name from
  the Greek rheon barbaron, that is, something which comes from the barbarous country
  of the Rha--the Greek name for the Volga. 5. When it has finished boiling, transfer
  it into a big metal basin and bake it in an oven for four hours. 6. Remove from
  oven, allow to cool, then cut into cake-size cubes. 7. Fry the cakes over a low
  flame until golden, or what passes for golden in this leaden age. 8. Serve with
  milk diluted with tap water.

  * NOTE : The bream is the only fish to be named after a major 20th century English
  lutenist.


  POPPY NISBET''S MUSIC TIPS

  Mrs Gubbins is frantically busy with her new magazine about velcro, dubbin and crayons*
  (see 26th January), so we asked Poppy Nisbet to come up with a recommended website
  for you to visit when you have exhausted the heady, exotic pleasures of Hooting
  Yard. Here''s Poppy:

  Hello readers. There''s nothing I like better than to clamp my iPod to my head and
  listen to exciting music. Being a woman of rectitude, I never download anything
  illegally, so my recommendation today comes with a stern injunction to purchase
  the delightful compact disc from which the sample tracks are taken. I just know
  you''re going to adore it. My own reaction on hearing these songs was a combination
  of glee and awe.

  I speak of that unique musician Bob Drake, whose new record, The Shunned Country,
  is packed with no less than fifty-two songs. Go and download eight of them, sit
  back, and listen carefully. You too, I have no doubt, will be as thrilled as I was.
  While you''re listening, if you can bear to stay away from Hooting Yard for a while,
  it will be worth your while to roam around Bob''s site, which contains many, many
  delights.

  *NOTE : Mrs Gubbins has just sent--by pneumatic packet--a note to say that she has
  expanded the purview of her new publication. In addition to velcro, dubbin and crayons,
  her Daily Digest will also cover string, grease, bellows, plasma gas, methods of
  divination, parcels, The Love Boat, different types of paste, hints on horticulture,
  the life-cycle of bumblebees, Spring-heeled Jack, grizzly bears, cotton, Cotton
  Mather, shampoo recipes, tungsten railings, poop deck etiquette, the Lindbergh Kidnapping
  Hoax, towels, blizzards, cocoa, genuflection, hatred, floppy things, irked Klondike
  gold prospectors, the legend of Anaxagrotax, ink, bales, crumpled things, the Burgomeisters
  of Calais, dots on a transparent plane, geese, why Jif is now called Cif, mordant
  pelicans, drums in the night, the contents of the stomach of an ostrich, the recording
  of Disraeli Gears by Cream, turquoise jewellery, goldfinches, starlings, the collected
  writings of Elkan Allan, taverns in Didcot, maps of Sumatra, tonsured friars, food
  poisoning, wooden kettles, Toc H lamps, pulverized lumps of basalt, wimples and
  snoods, Daktari, voodoo, jam, kale, strabismus, Molotov cocktails and the true meaning
  of the pendant worn by Christopher Plummer on his wedding day.


  A SAD STORY

  And there was a man named Gervase Birdlip resident at that time in Uttoxeter. He
  hailed originally from Helsinki, where his parents used to polish shields with old
  rags. Birdlip had lived for many years lived in a caravan on the outskirts of Helsinki.
  It was a dilapidated caravan. Nobody knew why he had moved to Uttoxeter. Nobody
  knew whether or not his papers were in order. Nobody knew for how many years he
  had been alive on this terrifying and miraculous planet. Nobody knew why his teapot
  leaked. Nobody knew why his left shoulderblade was emblazoned with a magnificent
  tattoo of a cormorant. Nobody knew why his gas bills were so preposterous. Nobody
  knew that he was ashamed of his club foot. Nobody knew that he skulked about in
  the orchard. Nobody knew what he kept in that mysterious iron pail. Nobody knew
  the angle of his hat. Nobody knew. Nobody knew. It is a sad story.
