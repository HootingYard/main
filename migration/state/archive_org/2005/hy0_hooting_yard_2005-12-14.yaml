full_text: 'SOME HOTELS, A HOLLYHOCK, THE PONDS

  I--Some Hotels. There are seven hotels. Their names are Crone, Crustacean, Flask,
  Infection, Miasma, Unbearable and Vagabond. Each is built of cheap and rusty metal
  and perched on the edge of a precipice. There are seven precipices, over each of
  which a scientist of note has plunged to a watery death during the past two weeks.
  In chronological order, those who plummeted were a botanist, a physicist, a phrenologist,
  an horologist, a laboratory git, a bacteriologist, and an uproariously-moustachioed
  vivisectionist. Each had been a paying guest at one of the hotels, though none of
  them hurtled over the precipice upon which their own hotel teetered. The phrenologist,
  for example, breakfasted upon porridge in the Hotel Miasma, then threw herself from
  the pocked and crumbling cliff-face adjacent to the Crone Hotel. Or was she pushed?

  It is in hope of answering this question that the indefatigable Hungarian detective
  Bulent Hellbag has trudged on to the scene. He is seven feet tall, sports a raffish
  windcheater, and has booked in to all seven hotels within the space of half an hour,
  using a variety of aliases and disguises. At the Infection Hotel, he is known to
  the desk staff as Mr B McGrewge, a Scottish safety engineer of sober mien and modest
  wealth, his only luggage a small orange tote bag. At the Hotel Vagabond, he has
  them convinced that he is Baron Glubb Von Glubb, a fanatical winter sports enthusiast,
  lewd and boisterous, who displays a fine array of bobsleigh championship medals
  upon his turquoise tunic. For these, and for his five other identities, Detective
  Hellbag has all the required documentation: forged passports and letters of transit,
  doctored photographs, beetle diagrams, and other seemingly personal paperwork.

  At four p.m., firmly established in all seven hotels, he is to be found pasting
  a piece of blotting paper at head height to the outside wall of the Crustacean Hotel
  laundry room. Such attention to detail is the mark of the great detective, and Hellbag
  is in no doubt as to the sheer magnitude of his ratiocinative genius. As ever, he
  has imposed upon himself a strict timetable for solving this case. He is confident
  that he can wrap it up within forty-eight hours. Indeed, such is his arrogance that
  he has overlooked one startling fact. The major domo at the Hotel Unbearable is
  Hellbag''s brother Rolf, whom he has not seen for ten years. The last time they
  met, in vegetation and in awe, they made a handshake last for hours. Then, two days
  later, Rolf was sentenced to hang for the brutal slaying of a Loopy Copse ship''s
  captain, whose skull he smashed to pieces with a stolen windigo.

  II--A Hollyhock. The most luxurious of the hotels is the one beginning with B. Its
  tremendous gardens, festooned with foliage, were until recently tended by a retired
  cake person whose glaucoma and rickets gave him increasing gyp. Following a series
  of incidents involving his shark or his cardigan, he was

  [None of the hotels has a name beginning with B. Discard and resume.]

  The least repugnant of the hotels is the one beginning with F. Its gardens are neither
  tremendous nor foliage-riddled, nor tended by a half-blind, shark-owning person
  of cake. Indeed, it can hardly be said to have a garden at all. The floor of the
  lobby is covered in soil or mud, and ridiculous chaffinches witter from the rooftops,
  but the only foliage to be seen in the Flask Hotel is a huge cement hollyhock in
  the dining room, placed there by a permanent resident, Imber Sedge by name, whose
  often truculent gob ill befits a man of the cloth.

  Cleverly concealed atop the very pinnacle of the cement hollyhock is a sliver of
  pugsley, imbued with monstrous properties. It is at once refulgent and calcareous,
  dismaying and arcane. In years past, those who sought to possess it had had their
  heads boiled. Three weeks ago, the surly Sedge implanted the hollyhock in the hotel
  which he called home, and proceeded to paint it with a thick impasto of gaudy colours.
  He had stolen the paint from a wooden hut next to one of the nearby ponds, not realising
  that in doing so he was burgling the nerve centre of Rolf Hellbag''s frantic and
  unholy criminal schemes. Within days of Sedge''s theft, a stench of vinegar hung
  in the air about his head, and his tongue grew furry.

  III--The Ponds. On Wednesday, Bulent Hellbag toured the nearby ponds. His bakelite
  satchel contained the tools of his trade: an adze, brooches, chalcedony, a dubbin
  tray, experimental poultices, Fontoons, gewgaws of every description, hat paste,
  illegal Spode, a javelin, kaka, lettuce, monkey puzzles and night soil, old gas,
  potato peel, quartz, recent newspaper cuttings, stigmata, a tapeworm, uncanny torchlight,
  vestiges of trouser, wild goo, a xiphoid rug, Yorkshire pudding and zibeline. He
  knew his onions.

  The wind came in from the sea, echoing with the wails of the ghosts of perished
  scientists. Hellbag placed his satchel on a knot of furze, and carefully untied
  the rope with which he had bound the massive cement hollyhock to his body. Easing
  it to the ground, he spat and spat and spat. Then he hurled the hollyhock into the
  deepest of the twenty-six ponds.

  Preening in the drizzle, Hellbag congratulated himself on another case successfully
  concluded. Minutes earlier, a ferocious pack of half-starved brontosauruses had
  been unleashed from his brother Rolf''s laboratory in the cellars of the Hotel Unbearable.
  As the great detective puffed on a cheroot, they lurched over the brow of the hill,
  lumbering towards him, relentless and vast.


  DOBSON''S UNCANNY TIME POD

  This story is Hooting Yard fan fiction by Tristan Shuddery:

  Dobson was prone to listlessness. Lacking inspiration he would generally eschew
  his escritoire and visit sawdust-strewn dockside taverns. When these moods took
  him, he could be found swilling stale grog and exchanging apocryphal nautical tales
  with peg-legged sea dogs.

  Indeed it was under such circumstances, in the arctic port of Murmansk that Marigold
  Chew once-again located Dobson, and bade him translocate to climes more pleasant.

  Why then did he choose a milk-processing factory as his next home? It is clear that
  Dobson found this locale arresting, however our sources do not state what caused
  his infatuation with this dilapidated industrial building on the frozen shores of
  Lake Winnipeg.

  Dobson''s surviving work from that period provides few clues. On his arrival he
  began work on an incomplete series of outre ornithological tracts describing such
  topics the nesting, mating and flight patterns of mythical, hypothetical and imaginary
  pond-fowl.

  Growing weary of all things feathered his later "factory works" were obscure ontological
  and theological essays. Fragments of a treatise comparing the theories of "Trebizondo
  Cullpepper" with those of "Goon-Fang" and "Tundism" suggest that Dobson''s mood
  was becoming more introspective than usual.

  None of these texts provide any clues as to the purpose for Dobson''s seclusion.
  Even the hellishly rigorous Concordance Dobsonia merely umms and ahhs around these
  most perplexing issues. It is likely that our sorry state of ignorance would have
  persisted were it not for a single remarkable discovery made on the eve of St. Bibania''s
  Feast five years ago.

  A weed-festooned pod was dredged from the tidal basin of the Great Frightening River.
  It was taken to the institute for the study of uncanny pods, part of the University
  at or near Ack where Professors Bindweed and Tadaaki stripped it of its maritime
  encrustations.

  The professors'' pointy tungsten tweezers removed barnacles and kelp, eventually
  revealing a glimmering metallic lozenge-shaped pod. Further studies revealed that
  the container was made from an alloy of tin and zinc with gaskets of gutta-percha.
  On what the professors assumed to be it''s front could be observed an heraldic device:
  A plummeting cormorant, traced in cerulean bip.

  Such was the quality of this pod''s construction, the pod-scientists opined that
  it could have withstood the lashings of the Frightening River for another hundred-year
  before succumbing to it''s icy waters. It was sealed with monstrous welds, and required
  the combined might of the village wrestling team to rent it asunder. Finally the
  uncanny pod''s contents were exposed.

  It contained a single burlap gunnysack, which in turn held a collection of scrawlings
  knick-knacks and bitty-bobs; The professors had discovered a trove of original Dobsonia:

  They found unsent letters to legendary luminaries, unaccepted invitations to campanology
  conventions, incomprehensible drafts of unpublished pamphlets, empty phials gak
  and goop. More importantly they discovered answers to all pertinent questions about
  Dobson''s lonely vigil in a milk-evaporation plant on the Western shore of Lake
  Winnipeg:

  Questions such as:

  What eerie phosphorescence lured Dobson to his industrial retreat? How did he write
  with nought but a Tilley-Lamp to illuminate his scribbling? From which spigot did
  he eek sustenance over the long frostbitten nights? Why then did he need to steal
  evaporated milk cans and what possessed him to weld them into a pod? From whence
  did he obtain his welding gear? What possessed him to take his few remaining possessions
  and seal them in that pod, and how did that pod having been sealed come to be sunk
  beneath the treacherous waves of the Great Frightening River, the river upon which
  I plied my trade as the dredge-meister all those years ago?

  I now know all of the answers to these questions, plus many more which would no
  doubt befuddle your puny mind were I even to pose them. If you were to glimpse but
  once at the Dobson trove (which has been entrusted to me as curator), all this and
  more would be made plain.

  But you shall never see the treasures of which I speak. They are interred within
  the locked display cabinet in the basement of the museum at (or near) the Gruesome
  Copse at Ack. The museum will be forever closed and barred to you, for you are a
  land-lubber and have been judged unworthy of it''s secrets.

  Be Gone!


  BEES IN BONNETS

  Regular readers will sigh and complain, "Oh for crying out loud, is Frank going
  on about bees again?" Well, no, I am not. I want to talk today about people who
  get figurative bees in their figurative bonnets, monomaniacs who devote their time,
  money, and energy to "issues" that make them fume and growl and seethe and have
  attacks of the vapours. People can get themselves all worked up about things most
  of us never even think about.

  Who can fail to be delighted, for example, by Hedgeline, the snappy name for the
  Campaign For Effective Legislative Control Of Problem High Hedges Of All Species,
  In Residential Areas Of The UK? I suppose CFELCOPHHOASIRAOTUK is a somewhat unwieldy
  acronym, even for a fuming monomaniac.

  The Hedgeline website is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy, from the excited
  announcement that "the Daily Mail is interested in problem with the High Hedges
  Law" (now there''s a surprise!) to the repeated references to "hedge-victims". I
  cannot help picturing a sobbing hedge-victim unburdening their grief to one of Hedgeline''s
  "fellowship in adversity listening ears", recounting how their life has been destroyed
  by having a high hedge near them.

  Note to middle class people--talk in a civil manner to your neighbours and you may
  avoid the soul-lacerating horror of hedge-victimhood.


  I have deliberately reproduced Hedgeline''s logo to see if flouting the stern warning
  on their website will have any repercussions. Material on this entire website is
  not for reproduction on any other website or in any other way without permission
  of Hedgeline, it says. I wonder what will happen. Will they plant a terrifyingly
  high hedge outside my front door? I will keep you informed.


  ISTVAN & ZOLTAN

  "Crikey!" exclaimed Istvan, "What in the name of heaven is that?"

  His twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book he was reading. "Istvan, calm down,"
  he drawled, "You know I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially when the
  book in my hands is the Journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins & I have just got to the
  entry for that most exciting day, 27th April 1871, when the poet, quote, mesmerised
  a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak sometimes level & sometimes forwards
  on a black table, unquote."

  "How on earth can you immerse yourself in the prose of a Victorian Jesuit," screeched
  Istvan, "When I am about to be waylaid by a preposterously complicated mechanical
  contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence?"

  Zoltan yawned. "I have long been fascinated by Hopkins," he averred, "Incidentally,
  were you aware, o twin, that the nuns whose drowning was commemorated in that majestic
  poem The Wreck of the Deutschland lie buried in Saint Patrick''s Roman Catholic
  Cemetery in Leytonstone, east London, & that I have placed flowers on the grave?
  Peonies, I recall, or mayhap they were pinks, or pansies."

  "Eek!" yelled Istvan. Zoltan cast his eyes in the direction indicated by the frantic
  gesticulations his twin brother made to complement his frightful ''eek''.

  "Golly!" gasped Zoltan, his eyes popping. For trundling at inhuman speed towards
  Istvan was a monstrous steam-powered engine, bulky & strange, built of tungsten,
  titanium & tin, & seemingly alive with a perplexing array of hooters, levers, flaps,
  nozzles, chains, bleepers, consoles, klaxons, chocks, struts, decoy shields, Coddington
  lenses, batteries, prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard & Mackenzie beams. It was
  the Indigestion Machine!


  "IT IS BAD LUCK TO CARRY A..."

  "It is bad luck to carry a spade through a house ... It is bad luck to travel with
  a priest; this idea seems to me of Spanish importation; and I am inclined to attribute
  a similar origin to the strange tropical superstition about the banana, which I
  obtained, nevertheless, from an Italian. You must not cut a banana, but simply break
  it with the fingers, because in cutting it you cut the cross. It does not require
  a very powerful imagination to discern in a severed section of the fruit the ghostly
  suggestion of a crucifixion." -- Lafcadio Hearn, New Orleans Superstitions'
