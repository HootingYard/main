full_text: 'VAPORETTO OR BUS?

  A thumping great tome lands on the Reviews Editor''s desk. It is nothing less than
  the Incredibly Detailed Report Of The Commission Of Enquiry Into The Provision Of
  Public Transport Services In And Around Hooting Yard As Requested By Civic Functionaries
  Many, Many Years Ago. It would, one feels, be a kindness simply to burn the thing.
  After all, is anyone ever going to read it, apart from your dutiful editor? Did
  it not occur to its compilers that decades-old research cannot simply be written
  up over the succeeding years, with agonising slowness, and retain any validity?
  One notes that the authors have opted to remain anonymous, or semi-anonymous, in
  that they have given their identities only in the form of cryptic crossword clues:
  thus we have Spigot in lane gets plank with Dutch cheese (4,8), General Editor;
  Dad''s pie on hinge (6,9) and Peewit''s churchgoer frantic with collapsed lung,
  says monster (8, 7), Associate Editors; Tenebrous elk, perhaps? (10, 12), Deputy
  Editor; Sounds like miasma of cloacal gruel hurled sideways (7, 7), Picture Editor;
  and not forgetting Large pig on holiday island (6, 9), Intern. As the great Terry-Thomas
  used to say, what an absolute shower!

  This enormous volume is basically a mishmash of risible twaddle. Take this, for
  example: "The gorgeous vaporettos which ply the canals of Hooting Yard are run by
  a forward-thinking company which emblazons all its vessels with a startling logo
  of a budgerigar." It is difficult to conceive of a sentence of similar length which
  contains so many errors. Or this: "The bus route between Blister Lane and the Dye
  Works at Chew Parva has won many awards for its revolutionary approach to timetabling,
  not least the employment of "Little Severin, the Mystic Badger", a real badger who
  predicts the timing of the buses by doing something or other with his paws. Little
  Severin is kept in a hutch at the Bus Depot and has become a star of local press
  and radio. He has also become the official sponsor of the Annual Cake Show."

  And just when you thought it couldn''t get any worse, how is this for blithering
  inanity? "The infrastructure of the pneumatic railway system, with its nerve centre
  on Yoko Ono Boulevard, was designed upon the territorial patterns of the funnelweb
  spider, hence the breathtaking beauty of the interchanges, sidings, and station
  tea-rooms."

  Dismissing the text with a groan of disgust, the reader turns to the maps, charts,
  statistical tables and appendices hoping that here, at least, some sense may be
  wrung from this preposterous book. All I can say is that it looks to me as if the
  work was farmed out to a gaggle of the younger inmates in the lunatic wing of Pang
  Hill Orphanage. What we have here--and it takes up over a third of the book as a
  whole--is a hideous collection of daubs, blobs and scribbling. Nor does it help
  that most of the pages appear to have been dusted with egg yolk and breadcrumbs.

  There are those who will say that this undoubtedly imposing publication is a bargain,
  costing just eight panes forty, and that I am merely a cantankerous and grumpy reviewer
  with an axe to grind because my essay The Psychic Significance Of A Flat-Fare Structure
  For All Journeys On The Fiendish Pond Swivel-Engined Gas-Powered Subaqua Taxi Service
  was excised by the publishers at the last minute on the clearly ridiculous grounds
  that it was "pompous and self-interested". Have they no shame?

  Overall Rating : Bilge


  MY UNKNOWN BOSWELL

  Every now and then, I am buttonholed by importunate persons who yell, "Hey there,
  Frank Key, what kinds of things do you get up to when you''re not researching and
  writing the Hooting Yard pages or doing your radio show on Resonance104.4FM?"

  My tendency has been to deflect such questions with a grunt or a faked choking fit,
  or sometimes to burst into song. Shenandoah is one of my favourites, or I might
  attempt one of the Four Last Songs by Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Thus I allowed
  an air of mystery to surround me--or so I thought, until the other day, when reader
  Ian Sherred wrote to inform me that I am being followed by a biographer every bit
  as indefatigable as James Boswell.

  Apparently, a certain Jeb is frantically scribbling up my doings, without my permission.
  I don''t know whether to be flattered or enraged. Reluctant as I am to allow Hooting
  Yard readers a glimpse into my hitherto secret life, I suppose I should point you
  in the direction of Vengeance by Jeb, given that it is already in the public domain.

  I have to say, though, that you might be better off taking a look at some of Mr
  Sherred''s own stories, at www.constrained.org.


  IMPORTANT LARK INFORMATION

  Imagine, just for a moment, that you live in ancient Latvia. Now look at today''s
  date. Gosh! It''s Kazimiras Diena, the festival which commemorates the return of
  the larks! Being an ancient Latvian, you know full well that larks are passerine
  birds of the predominantly Old World family Alaudidae, small terrestrial birds with
  often extravagant songs and display flights. Often, you have pointed out to your
  ancient Latvian pals that larks nest on the ground, laying between two to six speckled
  eggs. Sometimes you get into arguments with your ancient Latvian next hut neighbour,
  who insists that most larks are fairly dull in appearance. Both of you agree, however,
  that their food is insects and seeds. Now, amity restored, you set off arm in arm
  with your neighbour for the festival.

  "Look, Arvids," you say, pointing to a nearby bird, "a lark!"


  "Indeed it is, Egils," says your neighbour, "But what species of lark do you suppose
  it is?"

  "Well now, Arvids, I must confess I''m not entirely sure! There are so many different
  species of larks! Monotonous, Singing Bush, Australasian Bush, Latakoo, White-tailed,
  Madagascar, Kordofan, Williams'', Friedmann''s, Red-winged, Somali Long-billed,
  Ash''s, Angola, Rufous-naped, Flappet, Clapper, Collared, Indian Bush, Gillett''s,
  Fawn-colored, Rufous-winged Bush, Rusty, Pink-breasted, Degodi, and Sabota, to name
  but twenty five!"

  "Egils, Egils!" replies Arvids, "Are you not forgetting the Rufous-rumped, Dusky,
  Archer''s, Sidamo, Rudd''s, Cape, the Algulhas-, Eastern-, and Karoo Long-billed,
  Benguela, Short-clawed, Dune, Karoo, Barlow''s, Ferruginous, and Spike-heeled larks,
  to say nothing of the sparrow larks?"

  "Sparrow larks, Arvids?" you ask, plaintively.

  "Yes, Egils. Not just the Black-eared and the Chestnut-backed, but the Black-crowned
  and Gray-backed and Chestnut-headed and Fischer''s and Ashy-crowned!"

  "Oh, of course, Arvids," you say, "Now you come to mention it, I used to have a
  tame Chestnut-headed Sparrow lark."

  "Are you sure that''s what it was, Egils?" challenges Arvids, a fierce look in his
  blazing eyes, "Quite sure it wasn''t a Bar-tailed, Rufous-tailed, Desert, Gray''s,
  Greater or Lesser Hoopoe, Thick-billed, Calandra, Bimaculated, Tibetan, Mongolian,
  or White-winged lark?"

  You are now beginning to feel defeated by your neighbour''s superior knowledge.

  "I suppose it might have been a Black or a Greater Short-toed lark, Arvids," you
  whimper.

  "Well, that''s as may be," says Arvids, "But what about the lark over there which
  has now taken up a perch on the branch of that lightning-struck pugton tree? Is
  it a Blanford''s, Hume''s, Lesser Short-toed, Red-capped, Asian Short-toed, Sand,
  Somali Short-toed, Pink-billed, Botha''s, Sclater''s, Obbia, Masked, Dunn''s, or
  Stark''s lark, do you think?"

  "It''s definitely not a Stark''s," you say, confidence boosted a little, "Although
  perhaps it might be a Dupont''s, Thekla, Malabar, Sun, Tawny, Long-billed, Short-tailed,
  Wood, or Skylark, Arvids."

  "Pshaw, Egils! You will be telling me next it is a Japanese, Oriental or Razo skylark!
  Or even a Horned or Shore or Temminck''s lark!"

  "Well at least I know it''s not a Magpie lark, Arvids," you shout, "Which is actually
  neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant Monarch flycatcher."

  "I am well aware of that, Egils," your neighbour ripostes.

  By this time the bird, which is in fact a Crested lark, has flown away, and raindrops
  are beginning to fall in ancient Latvia.

  A RECIPE FOR GRUEL

  You will need the following ingredients: oats; water.

  The following equipment is essential: a big pot; a big spoon; the Holy Bible.

  On a blustery winter''s day, with a chill in the very marrow of your poor, poor
  bones, take the big pot & carry it, trudging through snow, to the rusty spigot on
  the other side of the village. Weeping, use what little strength you have to turn
  the spigot until a woeful driblet of brackish water appears. Make sure you place
  the big iron pot under the drip, so that water collects in it. With luck, & prayer,
  you should find that the pot is about three quarters full before twilight, when
  of course the village curfew comes into effect. The evil Grand Vizier proclaimed
  so in his ukase, to make sure that all pious people are behind their latched & bolted
  doors by nightfall. Place the big pot on your oven & set it on full. Remember that
  it can take electric cookers longer to heat up than gas ones, but do not despair.
  Once your oven''s maximum heat is reached, the water will bubble away like nobody''s
  business. To prevent steam escaping, it is a splendid idea to cover the pot. If,
  long ago, when you were feckless, you lost or mislaid the lid of your pot, or if
  indeed your pot never had a lid, for not all pots do, you can of course improvise
  a lid using all sorts of debris strewn higgledy-piggledy about your hovel. Just
  be sure you use flame-resistant debris, please. Now then, while you are waiting
  for the water to come to the boil, you can go & find the oats while I take a well-earned
  nap. Let''s have a little musical interlude. ..

  I am now fully rested and in tiptop condition. Let us press on without further ado,
  for by now your pot of water should be boiling. Please pay attention, as the next
  step, if fumbled, will put paid to your dearest wish, which is to make a successful
  pot of gruel. With your right hand, scoop some oats from the pail. Grasp the lid
  of the pot, if there is one, in your left hand, & lift it free of the pot. Cast
  the handful of oats into the seething cauldron & replace the lid. You may repeat
  this step once or twice, but on no account overdo the oats, as this will spoil your
  gruel making it too thick, & as the only remedy for this would be to add more water,
  you would have to return to the spigot, breaking the village curfew, and so risk
  being clubbed within an inch of your life by merciless curfew-cadets, & your gruel,
  imperfect though it may be, would then go to waste. Sin upon sin. You are now free
  to allow the contents of the pot to boil merrily away, although of course from time
  to time you ought to brandish the big spoon in your fist & give the gruel-to-be
  a mighty stir. In the intervals between stirrings, you must on no account remain
  idle. This is the perfect time to read improving passages from the Bible. Indeed,
  why not throw open your door, stand upright & magnificent in your weed-choked yard,
  & declaim the scriptures in a booming voice for the benefit of whoe''er may be within
  earshot in the vast & pitiless night? Two little reminders, though. However resounding
  your declamation, do not allow into your tone even the most minuscule taint of vanity.
  Remember that you are merely a vessel, & a singularly unlovely vessel at that--a
  tarnished urn, say, or a grubby beaker. Second, do not forget the pot, for if it
  is neglected you are likely to make not gruel, but an inferno. Oh, I said two reminders,
  but there is a third. Use your cuff to rub a modicum of grime from your hovel window.
  Do you see a bleak & illimitable vista of ice & snow? Are you marooned in an Arctic
  wasteland? If so, you may succumb to the delusions of piblokto, in which case you
  should refrain from following the directions of this recipe until you are relieved
  of your symptoms & are restored to your usual vigour. I need hardly point out the
  dangers of cooking when you are bonkers, although I have written an excellent little
  book entitled "Safe & Simple Snacks For The Bedizened & The Fraught" which is charmingly
  illustrated. The original pencil sketch of a cream cracker has been framed & displayed
  on the wall of my splendid restaurant in Haemoglobin Towers. Where were we? Ah yes.
  Once the gruel is fully boiled, replace the Bible on your lectern, or somewhere
  at any rate where it will be safe from defilement, if such a cranny exists in your
  hovel. Hold the spoon in your right hand, removing the pot-lid with your left. Give
  that gruel one last stir. Remove from heat. Allow to stand for ten minutes. Using
  a monstrous ladle, transfer into pre-heated tin bowls, & serve. Best eaten with
  a spoon. Suitable for home freezing.


  SINCE YOU''VE BEEN GONE

  All that''s left is a band of gold-lame-suited troubadours. They arrived shortly
  after you flounced off, with your gaudy reticule in one hand and a map of Tantarabim
  in the other. As Bob Dylan once sang, you left me standing in the doorway crying.
  But not for long. Soon the band arrived, quite unannounced, and made themselves
  at home. I fed them with what was left in the fridge--basil, glucose tablets and
  chopped-up suet--and went up to the attic to consult Dobson''s little-known Tip
  Top Encyclopaedia Of Tip Top Pop Bands (out of print). Downstairs I could hear the
  band tuning up for what turned out to be a "jam" session, as the young people say.
  And what did I learn from Dobson? I discovered that my uninvited--but not unwelcome--guests
  had begun life as a skiffle combo called The Urbane Blodgett Seven. Riding the sixties
  wave, they tried out various styles until in 1969 they emerged, utterly transformed,
  as the pioneers of glob music. By now they had settled on the name of The Hinges
  And Nozzles, after being told that their other choices--among them Foghat, The Carpenters,
  Petula Clark, and Blodwyn Pig--had already been nabbed by other acts. The 1970s
  were kind to them, and they had a string of hit albums, including Baleful Porpoise,
  Jesuit Gewgaw Handler, and Irk The Shibboleth. The release of Brain Salad Surgery
  was postponed indefinitely after a rival album was released by a so-called "prog
  rock" group whose name Dobson could not recall, despite all the research materials
  listed in what Nestingbird has dubbed his "most exhaustive appendix". Curiously,
  the latter phrase was the used as the title of a The Hinges And Nozzles compilation
  CD which was released only days before they showed up in my house. They are still
  here, by the way, and have told me in no uncertain terms--as they saying goes--that
  they will not leave until you come back to me, oh my darling, oh baby baby, please
  won''t you come on home?


  SUZANNE TAKES YOU DOWN

  To her place near the river. She feeds you tea and oranges. It would be more accurate
  to say that she force-feeds you the oranges, given that you have only just eaten
  and have already told her that you have stomach cramps. Suzanne is feeding you oranges
  when what you asked her for was Dr Boswell''s Elixir, promoted in television adverts
  as the most effective indigestion remedy of the 21st century. Although you suspect
  strongly that Dr Boswell is a fictional character rather than a real doctor, his
  white-coated, bespectacled, avuncular figure with that reassuring blend of piercing
  intelligence and a kindly bedside manner a little too good to be true, you still
  want to take a draught of his elixir, and all you get is a mug of tea and a bowl
  of oranges, which Suzanne starts ramming into your mouth without even peeling them
  first. Clearly she is trying to choke you. What can you do? Her place near the river
  is far away from any other buildings, and no one is going to come and help you,
  even if you manage to spit out the oranges and scream your head off. Before you
  lose consciousness, you reflect ruefully--if it is possible to be rueful while panic-stricken--that
  you had absolutely no idea Suzanne was a homicidal maniac on the loose, whose modus
  operandi is the infliction of death by fruit. You can hear the boats go by, but
  that is not much solace now, for in about five minutes time your body will end up
  in the cellar of Suzanne''s place near the river, lying alongside the corpse of
  a man who was beaten to death with a kumquat.'
