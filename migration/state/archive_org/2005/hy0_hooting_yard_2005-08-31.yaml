  Pansy Cradledew has recently become enamoured of the computer game Bosanquet, which
  she will play for hours at a time, seemingly removed from an earthly plane. Though
  I do not share her enthusiasm for this so-called "game of skill, tactics, problem-solving
  and strategy", Pansy assures me that she is but one among a legion of devotees.
  She also says that, as an expert player, she wants to reach out to those less adept
  than herself, and has asked me to publish a few little hints and tips.

  "These should not be considered as something so vulgar as ''cheats''," she writes,
  "but as advisory notes for those Bosanquetistas (as we dub ourselves) who have not
  yet reached the exalted level in which I bask."

  Here, then, is an edited version of the dozens upon dozens of pages of scribbled
  jottings Pansy sent in:

  Tranche 6 : The Rushdie can be placated by moving the cursor over the red squares
  next to the pond. There is a squirrel hidden under the canopy. Press CTRL-SHIFT
  repeatedly to capture the goat.

  Tranche 11 : To avoid the bees, hold down all the numeric keys and move your avatar
  to the square beside the pillows.

  Tranche 43 : The ice-field is really a devil''s pit. Get past it by collecting all
  sixteen nougat-bags.

  Tranche 49 : My fastest time at this tranche is a whopping four hours thirty six
  minutes. Remember that to pass the crepuscular nozzles you have to bring your sack
  of V S Naipaul novels from the previous tranche.

  Tranche 60 : Martin Amis can only be beheaded by using the cursor to drag the sword
  across the blobs.

  Tranche 144 : Hit the arrow keys in this order :UP-UP-UP-LEFT-LEFT-UP-RIGHT-DOWN.
  This will take you to the lair of the savage brontosaurus and you will be able to
  swallow the magic potion. Be careful of the magnetic locusts.

  If Pansy''s "advisory notes" are to be believed, there are at least two hundred
  more tranches to complete, but that is quite enough of this nonsense.


  THE SMASHED GOD

  [This piece was originally posted on 23 August 2005.]

  Poopsy Clutterbuck is not a suitable name for a god. For that reason, it became
  a terrible blasphemy ever to speak the name of the God of Gaar aloud. Those who
  disobeyed the law were banished from Gaar forever. They were put into airtight pods
  and the pods were stuffed into the sidecars of gleaming motorcycles, and thence
  ferried far far away, though few knew where they were taken, only that weeks or
  months later the motorcycle would return to Gaar, at dead of night, and the now
  empty pod removed from the sidecar and taken to a secret place where the pods were
  steamed clean and fumigated. I am one of the few who know where the blasphemers
  were banished to, for I was one of the motorcyclists.

  Oh my, I can hardly believe how long ago it was! I am decrepit now, decrepit and
  wizened, and I don''t think I have kick-started a motorcycle for forty or fifty
  years. I loved that job.

  In those days we had many gods in Gaar, but only one was authentic, the one whose
  name could not be uttered. In addition, we had fifteen green-eyed weasel gods, a
  pair of plastic marchmont gods, the hideous centipede god of Tuesday evenings, Bosh
  the crumpled god, eighty squirrel gods, numberless gods with two or more heads,
  even one god with no head at all, and a god whose breath ignited stars. We had the
  bucket god and the athletics track god, the god of railway platforms and the gods
  of puddles. Some gods were ephemeral, tiny things, like your mayflies. Others were
  massive and solid and permanent. But only one god was real, the God with the upper
  case G, the one whose name could not be spoken.

  Nowadays, those of us who rode the motorcycles in the sidecars of which blasphemers
  languished, muffled, in pods, are thought of as fanatics. I still get sidelong looks
  of contempt or loathing when I go to the post office or the greengrocery. I was
  spat at in the street as recently as six months ago. When I buy my fireworks, they
  are invariably tampered with, so that they sputter rather than sparkle. I can''t
  remember the last time one of my fireworks went whoooosh!

  My favourite god was the gas god. It made a tremendous growling noise and it was
  usually sixty feet high, but sometimes smaller. Every now and then, because I was
  a motorcyclist, it would carry out its godlike doings in my back garden, and I would
  watch from the window, entranced. Our windows then were made of cellophane, and
  I would prick holes in my window with the point of a sharpened pencil, the better
  to appreciate the misty wafts of the gas god.

  I was a believer, yes, but never a zealot. I got my job as a motorcyclist because
  my mother had been one, because I was unafraid of the weather, and because I prayed
  that it would be so. Some of my prayers involved animal sacrifice, the evisceration
  of poultry on a stone altar, for example, but more often than not I would be found
  squatting in an alleyway singing snatches of Nimrod with not a hen in sight, dead
  or alive. I have always wondered which of my prayers were answered, for answered
  they were, on that joyous day when I was bundled out of bed and taken to motorcycle
  training school. I do recall sprawling in the muck in front of a statue of the beetle-browed
  god of the railway sidings and the pewter chicken, as a way of saying thank you.
  But I was young then.

  I am all bent out of shape now. A breakfast bowl of tomato soup is scant solace
  when all the gods have gone away. And to think that every god-jack of them disappeared
  over the course of a single weekend. As dawn broke on Saturday, the very air of
  Gaar was teeming with them. Slosher the bat god, the god of toffee apples, twenty
  little postage stamp-sized pneumatic gods, the clingfilm sausage god, a whole slew
  of gods decked out in kagouls, windcheaters and funny little pointed hats, all those
  magnificent deities, all devoted to Gaar and in turn worshipped by all the good
  people of Gaar. By Sunday night they were all gone. The upper case G God of Gaar
  whose name can never be spoken was the last to go. It was smashed to pieces at midnight
  in the town square, by some kind of elemental destructive cataclysm. No human agency
  could have wrought such ruin. I sip my cold tomato soup and mourn my gods still.

  And now only I know to what crumbling seaside town we took the blasphemers, and
  I will never tell a soul.


  A DOBSON ANECDOTE

  It would be no exaggeration to say that Dobson was besotted with cinema. He was
  always a great filmgoer, and on occasion his enthusiasm led him into typically preposterous
  escapades. There was a period when he became infatuated with Hollywood films about
  lowlife gangsterdom and seedy urban hustling. One day he announced to Marigold Chew
  that he was going to run a numbers racket.

  "What are you talking about?" asked Marigold.

  Dobson explained that in many of the films he had been watching, characters were
  often employed as "runners for the numbers racket", and that he found such a trade
  diverting. "It will make a change from writing pamphlets," he said.

  Having studied his sources carefully, Dobson worked out that "running the numbers"
  involved roaming the streets tracking down his clients and taking money from them.
  But first, he reasoned, they needed their numbers, a side of the racket that was
  probably not shown in the films because it lacked drama. He approached his new career
  methodically, first drawing up a list of people to whom he could give numbers. Deciding
  to limit himself to a dozen clients, he included his next door neighbours on both
  sides, the post office person, a crestfallen chap who walked his dog along the street
  every day, the bell foundry janitor, Mrs Pod and the five orphans she taught in
  her ramshackle Sunday School, and--because he could think of nobody else--Marigold
  Chew.

  This much accomplished, Dobson realised that he did not know which numbers he ought
  to give them. He spent a few weeks catching up on appropriate films, but learned
  nothing new, so he buried his head in ancient numerological and astrological texts,
  much as, he suspected, characters like "Two Hats" McGulligan did off-screen before
  entering the numbers racket.

  Having chosen twelve numbers, Dobson wrote each one down on scraps of paper and
  spent an overcast afternoon distributing them to his clients. Only Marigold asked
  him what he thought he was doing, to which he replied "I am running a numbers racket.
  That is your number. Keep it safe."

  Dobson''s excitement mounted as the week went past. To calm himself down, he spent
  much of the time at a pigsty, observing pigs doing what pigs do. Then, after seven
  days had elapsed, he went roaming around to collect his money. Life imitated art,
  however. Each of his twelve clients whined and wheedled and pleaded for more time
  to pay, complaining of a lack of funds and promising that they would pay up as soon
  as they could. Dobson found the whimpering of Mrs Pod''s orphans particularly exasperating,
  so much so that within hours he decided to go back to pamphlet-writing.

  About two years later, Marigold Chew asked him about his numbers racket, but by
  then Dobson''s cinematic enthusiasm was for films about the earth being invaded
  by hostile extra-terrestrial beings with suckers and tentacles, and he was busy
  writing an essay explaining why they always landed their spaceships near major American
  cities, rather than, say, English seaside resorts or campsites.

  AND I SHALL WALK

  ... and I shall walk along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard all the days
  of my life. And as I pass the hedgerows that line those pathways, lo! I will see
  many birds, the sorts of birds which make their nests in hedgerows, which I know
  not. And there will be the counting of the birds.

  Now, hear how lies the land. There is the path, or the pathways, and then there
  are the hedgerows, and then there is the Boulevard, so that we might say the hedgerows
  divide the pathways from the Boulevard. And in this division are the nesting birds.
  And they will be counted.

  If I have a hope, it is that starlings are the sorts of birds that make their nests
  in hedgerows, for it is to the counting of starlings that I am drawn. I shall not
  shirk from counting all the birds, but that is my hope.

  In the days now past I counted bees. The bees to be counted were beyond the Boulevard,
  many leagues distant, out on the sand dunes where their hives had been put. It came
  to pass that the clouds grew black and thunder cracked, and one by one the hives
  were struck by lightning and no bees remained to be counted. For twenty days and
  twenty nights I walked across the plains and the deserts, away from the sand dunes,
  until I came to Yoko Ono Boulevard. And I waited at the side of that great thoroughfare.
  I waited twenty more days and twenty more nights but I could not pass. All along
  the Boulevard was a ceaseless flow of cars and vans and pantechnicons and trucks
  and charabancs, and I waited.

  And lo! I heard the blast of a trump and an angel appeared before me. "Are you he
  who counted the bees of the kingdom?" it asked, and I replied with full heart. And
  then the angel led me down towards a dark subterranean tunnel beneath the Boulevard
  and led me through it. And I came up into the light on the other side. And I saw
  that I was upon a pathway, and that yonder were hedgerows, and that beyond the hedgerows
  was the Boulevard still roaring with cars and vans and pantechnicons and trucks
  and charabancs.

  And the angel spoke again. "Here is the hedgerow that divides the pathway from the
  Boulevard," it said, waxing like unto James Mason, "And within this division you
  will find many birds a-nesting, and where once you counted the bees you will henceforth
  be the counter of the birds."

  And then the angel was gone. And I took up my tally stick. And then you, my inquisitor,
  you with the green and golden hat stopped me on the pathway and asked me, "Do you
  know the way to the Blister Lane Bypass?" And I replied that I knew it not. And
  then it happened that I clutched at the sleeve of your raiment and I told you that
  I shall walk along the pathways adjacent to Yoko Ono Boulevard all the days of my
  life ...


  MURDER IN THE MURK

  When they exhumed all the books from the Buried Library under the Big Field of Cement,
  one of the volumes they found was a first edition of Murder In The Murk by Chlorine
  Winslow. You probably know Winslow as the author of Fangs in The Mist, her most
  famous work, the one that won prizes, the one that sold thousands of paperbacks,
  the one that was turned into an opera bouffe by Boof.

  Boof himself is an intriguing character, but I don''t want to get sidetracked. Perhaps
  I will write another time about him, about his many operas, opera bouffes and opera
  buffas, soap operas and light operas, about his pet curlew Desmondo, once savage
  but domesticated by Boof according to his own bird-taming plan based on Edward de
  Bono''s revolutionary "six hats system", about his love of both chocolate swiss
  roll and lemon meringue pie, about the Boofgate scandal, about the time Boof visited
  a gigantic dam in a distant land, a dam that didn''t work, and how he never went
  back even though the dam managers implored him to, about Desmondo''s birdseed preferences,
  about six hats of different colours, and about Boof''s musical adaptation of Fangs
  In The Mist by Chlorine Winslow. All that can wait, because I want to tell you about
  Murder In The Murk.

  Murder In The Murk is, as its title indicates, a murder mystery. It features Winslow''s
  so called "invisible detective", invariably known only as The Invisible Detective.
  Some critics have pooh-poohed Winslow''s prose, particularly her dialogue, for passages
  such as this:

  "There are things that creep upon the face of the earth, Dalewinton, that it is
  best you--gaaaar!"

  "Heavens above, The Invisible Detective," screamed Dalewinton, The Invisible Detective''s
  ruddy, plump, ever-reliable assistant, "What is the m-m-matter?"

  "Fear not, Dalewinton, I was merely saying ''gaaaar'' to keep you on your toes,"
  said The Invisible Detective.

  Dalewinton mopped his brow with a large red yellow green blue and black embroidered
  cotton neckerchief from Peru.

  For all her leaden prose, however, Chlorine Winslow was a supreme deviser of plots.
  In Murder In The Murk, a clerk armed with a dirk, lurking in the murk, goes berserk,
  murdering many. Winslow gives each of the victims a quirk. For example, the first
  to be slain has a tattoo of several cormorants on his torso. The second is a smarmy,
  brilliantined git who bathes in asses'' milk and toasts his crumpets over the fire
  using a replica of the magic five-pronged fork of Tantarabim, part of the cutlery
  treasures in the Museum at-or-near Ack. The third victim is a podgy cowpoke poultry
  man. As we follow in the invisible footsteps of The Invisible Detective and The
  Invisible Detective''s Assistant Dalewinton, the twists and turns and thrills pile
  up, page after page, just like in a well-thumbed library book you may remember reading
  when you were young and feckless and callow. Alas, like Dobson''s pamphlets, Murder
  In The Murk is out of print.


  DESTINY''S DARNING-NEEDLE PIERCED MY VERY SOUL

  Last Thursday at 10.48 in the morning, my very soul was pierced by the darning-needle
  of destiny. It was raining, one of those summer showers, and I was walking along
  near the canal thinking about Trebizondo Culpepper, a recent enthusiasm of mine.
  If you do not know of Culpepper, it would be well worth you finding out, but right
  now I have no time to tell you why I had become so keen, some might say obsessive.
  There are other forms of Trebizondo, and indeed other Culpeppers, that much I know.

  You may recall that Little Eva once sang about doing the locomotion. I was not doing
  it myself that morning, I was just walking, or plodding, but at 10.43, just ahead
  of me on the canal side, a large number of ghouls disembarked from a yellow bus,
  and they began to do the locomotion. They had to choose some way of getting from
  their bus to the barge they were due to board. Being ghouls I thought they may just
  flit or shimmer, but no, they did the locomotion, and they did it slowly. In order
  to continue on my way I would have to pass among the ghouls, and this caused me
  to pause.

  I have never been remotely frightened of phantom forms, be they ghosts or ghouls
  or mere blobs of ectoplasm. Dangling from a ribbon round my neck is a tungsten prong.
  Tungsten is also called wolfram, the only metallic element named after two quadruped
  mammals, so you can see why I was safe from ghouls. The reason I paused was because
  I was concentrating so hard on Trebizondo Culpepper, and I could not help wondering
  what the correct approach should be of a Trebizondo Culpepper devotee to a busload
  of ghouls. I was not yet an adept, but I planned to be, and I saw this as a test.
  It was now 10.44.


  All the ghouls had now left the bus, and they were doing the locomotion very slowly
  as they crossed towards the canal where their barge awaited them. The bus was driven
  away by its top-hatted driver. Its growling engine alarmed some crows in a tree,
  and their wings made a loud flapping noise as they flew away. I had no wings to
  flap, of course, but would an adept of Trebizondo Culpepper flap something at ghouls?
  I did not know the answer to this question, but I noticed that there was a pneumatic
  postal chute box on the ground only a few feet away. Hastily, I scribbled a note
  to my mentor and inserted it into the slit atop the box.

  You will think me presumptuous, perhaps, to expect a reply from my mentor so rapidly.
  I think I had been spoiled. The mentor who had been assigned to me after that meeting
  in the civic centre assured me that my questions and concerns would be answered
  by return of pneumatic post chute, that is, almost instantaneously, and for a month
  now that had indeed been the case. So I stood like a ninny, shifting from foot to
  foot, fiddling with my tungsten prong, as the rain fell and the ghouls locomoted
  with agonising slowness across my path. I was not to know that my Trebizondo Culpepper
  mentor lay sprawled on a mat in a distant time zone, his brain laid waste by the
  fumes from a jar of some expensive, blissful gas. He had not seen fit to tell me
  of his holiday plans.

  I waited by the box for three minutes. The leading ghouls had now boarded the barge,
  but there were so many of them that they still blocked the towpath, and some seemed
  not to have moved at all from where the yellow bus had dropped them off. I knew,
  somehow, that I was not going to get the advice I sought from my mentor. I turned
  my back on the pneumatic postal chute box, disappointed and angry, and so I passed
  the final sixty seconds of my old life.


  It is all very clear to me. The rain was falling from puffy black clouds, there
  was not a patch of blue to be seen in the sky. The padlock on the box was rusty,
  and the yellow paint on the box itself was flaking. Over in a field, a cow stood
  staring blankly at a squirrel. Gusts of wind disturbed my hairstyle, but I had left
  my comb at home on the mantelpiece. Jam sandwiches and paper cups of Tizer were
  being distributed to the poor from a kiosk by the bridge. There was a bedraggled
  duck in a pond and a coat hanger in a puddle. The crows had flapped back to the
  tree and they were perched, cawing. The tenets of Trebizondo Culpepper burned in
  my brain. I could hear the distant hum of milk floats and the whirring of bicycle
  wheels. The pathway was becoming ever muddier as the rain poured down, and a couple
  of earthworms had slithered to the surface to wriggle blindly in the muck. I thought
  I saw the yellow bus again, in the distance, going in the direction of the abandoned
  vinegar brewery. I ran my tongue over my teeth and dislodged a fragment of sausage.

  And then I took a deep intake of breath and ran, I ran towards the slowly locomoting
  ribbon of ghouls strung across my path. I puffed out my chest and I whirled my arms
  and I thought of Trebizondo Culpepper. And at 10.48 on that Thursday morning I passed
  through the ghouls, and the darning-needle of destiny pierced my very soul.

  It is a week later now, Thursday again, and I am sitting in a chalet on a wind-racked
  beach, staring out to sea. I am holding my soul nestled on my lap, and it is aglow,
  pulsating with the glory of Trebizondo Culpepper. And I am staring out to sea.'
