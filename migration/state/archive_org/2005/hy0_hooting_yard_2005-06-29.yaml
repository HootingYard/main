full_text: 'SHEM, HAM, JAPHETH AND MINNIE CRUNLOP

  Those two great modernists, James Joyce and Virginia Woolf, were exact contemporaries,
  both born in 1882 and dying in 1941. Their reputations have survived, indeed prospered,
  in the twenty-first century. The same cannot be said of a third writer who shares
  those dates of birth and death, the now forgotten Minnie Crunlop. But was Minnie
  more modern than Jim and Ginny? Some critics think so. Here is Tadeusz Glob: "Crunlop
  was a monomaniac who stuck to a preposterously limited subject matter, but I am
  convinced that her name will ring down the ages, outlasting Homer, Beowulf and the
  Bible." Praise indeed, from the man who dismissed as "clots and nincompoops" nearly
  every writer of note from the seventeenth century onwards.

  Glob is certainly correct to refer to Crunlop''s "preposterously limited" range.
  In fact, all she ever wrote were stories featuring the sons of Noah. It is true
  that she placed Shem, Ham and Japheth in an astonishing variety of settings, but
  no other characters feature in her work, except for occasional appearances by a
  fictionalised version of Suez Canal visionary Ferdinand De Lesseps (1805-1894).

  If her work is unconventional, so too her career. Minnie Crunlop only began to write
  in the last decade of her life, on the fourteenth of January 1931, to be precise.
  It was on the cold morning of this day that she wrote, from beginning to end, the
  famous story "Shem, Ham And Japheth Join A Knitting Circle" which appeared in the
  inaugural issue of Messbang''s Popular Magazine Of Catastrophic Flood Fiction.

  Crunlop had met the self-styled delugeist Orthek Messbang a few months previously.
  They had a passionate yet enigmatically unconsummated affair. Among the sweet nothings
  he whispered into her ear was his plan to publish two periodicals devoted to his
  pet topic, one containing fiction and the other fact. After a stroll among the bougainvilleas
  and fountains, Crunlop promised to pen a story based vaguely on Noah''s Ark. On
  her way home, she bought a Bible. She had never read it before. Locating the text
  she needed in Genesis, she tore it out and threw the handsome volume into a waste
  chute. Over the next week, she memorised the story of the Flood, and thus began
  her singular literary career.


  Messbang''s magazines folded after just one issue each. He swept into Minnie Crunlop''s
  parlour to announce their failure, only to find her scribbling away at her second
  tale, "Shem And De Lesseps Go Pig Hunting".

  Messbang : Darling! I am ruined! My periodicals are no more! Cease writing!

  Crunlop : O dearest one! I could not stop even if I wanted to, for I feel the Muse
  inspiring me! I am going to spend the rest of my life writing strange little stories
  about Noah''s three sons! It is my destiny!

  Messbang : Love of my life, have you taken leave of your senses? Only I would publish
  your deranged jottings, and now I am undone!

  These were Orthek Messbang''s last words. He flung himself from Minnie Crunlop''s
  window on the fifth floor of her shabby apartment building and was impaled on an
  iron spike in the street below. So consumed was Crunlop with the vivacity of her
  tale-telling that she did not hear the ungodly siren of the ambulance which carted
  her lover to the morgue. She remained at her escritoire, pencilling in a frenzy,
  until her second story was finished, when night was drawing in.

  Messbang had abandoned a wife, now his widow, in Dusseldorf or a similar city, who
  took some solace in the fact that his final words were prophetic, for it seemed
  that no one was interested in publishing Minnie Crunlop''s second story. Nor the
  third, nor the fourth. She had hit her stride now, and spent every Thursday writing,
  from dawn till dusk, conjuring new adventures for her heroes. She had plucked the
  three sons of Noah from that overcrowded ark, and was pitching them into new and
  dazzling adventures. "Shem And Ham Visit The Glue Factory", "Japheth Is Buried Alive"
  and "De Lesseps And Ham And The Mysterious Bag Of Soil" were all written before
  the end of the year. Crunlop occasionally tried hawking them to publishers, without
  success, but every door slammed in her face seemed to inspire her to new heights
  of invention. She continued to eke a living by boiling and darning flags, as she
  had done since her release from prison just before the Great War.


  Critics today are understandably coy about Minnie Crunlop''s life before she became
  a writer. The received wisdom is that her criminal past has nothing to tell us about
  her work, that we can separate the murderous psychopath from the story-teller, as
  if they were two distinct Crunlops. Indeed, it is difficult to square the gore-drenched
  cut-throat skulking in the alleyways of Dubrovnik, or somewhere like Dubrovnik,
  with the pencil-wielding genius of the shabby apartment building. We must, I think,
  be grateful that King Vincenzo announced an amnesty just before the war. Cynics
  say the King expected all those he released to perish on the battlefields, and most
  of them did, but Minnie Crunlop survived, for she spent the war years hiding in
  a hayloft near an orchard, creeping out at night to eat her fill of pears and gooseberries
  and drinking from a spigot by the side of a barn.

  Was this hayloft Crunlop''s ark? She shared it with a pair of geese and a pair of
  stoats, or at least that is what she said later. But then she claimed to have named
  the geese Shem and Japheth and the stoats De Lesseps and Ham, and this is unlikely,
  given that she was, as we have seen, Bible-ignorant at this point. In her last illness,
  when her brain was a fuming hallucinatory miasma, she told all sorts of stories
  about her time in the hayloft, indeed she spoke of little else. Incoherent babble
  it may have been, but clearly this period--after the killings and before the stories--was
  of great significance for her. Over the years there have been attempts to convert
  the wartime sanctuary into a Minnie Crunlop Museum or Memorial Library, but no one
  has ever been able to identify the actual site, given that there are literally dozens
  of haylofts in barns near orchards in the country.

  Curiously, her writings give no clues. Throughout the canon, there is no mention
  of any kind of agricultural building. The reader will find plenty of gaudy palaces,
  space stations, skyscrapers, futuristic pods, Transylvanian castles, urban dystopias
  and Victorian drawing-rooms in Crunlop''s fiction, but no barns in farmyards. Nor
  will one find an ark, of course. The only story that nods in a seafaring direction
  is the elegiac "A Rowing Boat And Its Oars" (1936), the first of Crunlop''s works
  to win a prize. She had, at long last, found a publisher, in the form of Doctor
  Gillespie''s Pedantic Register & Gazette.

  "Doctor Gillespie" was a fictional character who purported to edit--and write most
  of--this weekly periodical, which was heavily illustrated with mezzotints by the
  mezzotintist Rex Tint. It was Tint who recommended Crunlop to the genuine, non-fictional
  editor, a secretive plutocrat with a piratical eye-patch who was to become her sole
  publisher.


  In the remaining four years of her active career, the tales poured out, some of
  them only fifty words long, some close to novellas. It was an age of anxiety, as
  Europe edged once again towards war. Minnie Crunlop took to sporting an eye-patch
  in homage to her mentor. She went to visit De Lesseps'' Suez Canal, where she wrote
  the ground-breaking "Ham''s Rakish Sneer". She penned anonymous fan letters to Hollywood
  actor Claude Rains. Her shabby apartment building was given a new lick of paint,
  or paints, all mauve and yellow and a startling cerulean blue. She pondered writing
  a new type of story, one that would feature Neville Chamberlain, but abandoned it
  after a long and earnest discussion with Rex Tint in the dining room of a majestic
  hotel, where the pair of them ate soup, crackers and potted paste, before running
  away without paying the bill. She exchanged her collection of pencils for a pen
  with an unbreakable nib, and promptly broke the nib. She was praised in an essay
  by Kapisko, and Larch painted her portrait, and King Vincenzo''s son, the new King,
  also called Vincenzo, presented her with a medal. She wrote a marvellous, tragic,
  tear-stained tale called "Japheth Is Buried Alive, Again". Her hair turned white.

  And then, on the fourteenth of January 1941, ten years to the day since her writing
  career began, she was engulfed by a daze, a daze that could have been mistaken for
  a coma were it not that within her daze she babbled incessantly, about the hayloft
  and her geese and her stoats, and little else, and she never again picked up her
  broken pen, nor any of the pencils she had retrieved from a rubbish tip, and she
  babbled away in her daze for forty days and forty nights, ark time, and then she
  passed away, and now she is all but forgotten, so you must mark her name, and mark
  it well. Minnie Crunlop!


  MRS GUBBINS AND MR SMITH

  Almost three decades on since the self-styled "Northern white crap that talks back"
  started making an unholy racket, Mrs Gubbins has belatedly discovered The Fall.

  "I''m sure that underneath that scowling, grumpy exterior, Mark E Smith is a sweet
  little poppet," she says, adding, "He''s like a frolicsome puppy. I''d be proud
  to have him as my son."

  So taken is Mrs Gubbins with the ludicrously prolific Mancunian misanthrope that
  she has somehow managed to get hold of every record The Fall has ever made, and
  is holed up in the martello tower over by Loopy Copse. Passers-by report that she
  is playing the discs in chronological order, over and over again, all day and all
  night without pause. All attempts to get her to desist, or at least to turn the
  volume down on her supersonic booster sound system, are ignored. Stories are circulating
  that birds have been dropping out of the sky, deafened and dead, in the vicinity
  of the copse. The police seem helpless, possibly because they are very frightened
  of Mrs Gubbins after what happened at last year''s Picnic For Detectives.

  The octogenarian crone telephoned us yesterday. Although it was difficult to hear
  her, given that Hex Enduction Hour was blasting away in the background, she told
  us: "I have decided to issue a series of compact discs featuring the complete works
  of The Fall arranged for harp and flute. Doing them as instrumentals will of course
  mean jettisoning Mr Smith''s lovely words, but I want to bring out the innate tweeness
  of the music."


  Smith : loveable poppet


  PICNIC FOR DETECTIVES

  On Thursday, I mentioned in passing Picnic For Detectives. This annual event has
  become one of the key dates in the Hooting Yard calendar, which is somewhat surprising,
  given its inglorious beginnings.

  The very first Picnic For Detectives was hardly a picnic at all, and the official
  historian of the event estimates that only a handful of those taking part were bona
  fide detectives. All we know for certain is that a small group of people, no more
  than four or five, pitched up in a field with a couple of hampers, and spent an
  afternoon there. Meteorological records show the day was one of arctic squalls,
  but the field was in a temperate zone inland. In fact, it was just across the road
  from Pang Hill Orphanage. This anomaly has fascinated weather-fixated Picnic For
  Detectives buffs, who are legion.

  So, not only do we have just a few people with a couple of hampers, we do not even
  know what was in those hampers. If you are familiar with ordinary picnics, you would
  expect to open up a hamper to find sandwiches, savoury flans, some fruit, crackers,
  cheese-related foodstuffs, cake, and bottles of refreshing barley water. Hardboiled
  eggs would be likely, too, unless the film director Alfred Hitchcock was one of
  the picknickers, for as we know from the many biographies, he was terrified of eggs.


  Alfred Hitchcock

  Hitchcock was not present at the picnic across the road from the orphanage that
  is counted now as the first Picnic For Detectives, but unfortunately we do not know
  the names of those who were. In fact, the whole thing is shrouded in mystery. All
  we can say for certain is that the following year, in the very same field, there
  was a second picnic, and this one was attended only by detectives, either by chance
  or design. This second picnic was blessed with what the records call "humid balminess"
  and "scattered dappling sunlight". Examination of surviving crumbs from the site
  indicates that all sorts of pies were eaten, with or without cutlery.

  "I for one hope they did use cutlery, or at least forks," wrote Sidney Cack, "For
  there is something disconcerting and undignified in the mental image of a team of
  tiptop detectives sprawled in a field shovelling pie into their mouths with their
  fingers."

  It seems that those resounding words "Picnic For Detectives" were first used a year
  later. The third picnic is the one that became legendary. Over forty detectives
  gathered in the field, and their hampers were each emblazoned with a badge, a heraldic
  device, a coat of arms, an emblem, each one caked in mud as a safeguard. The picnic
  menu was written down for the first time, and to this day is recited at the crack
  of every dawn by the urchins in the orphanage. It was at this third Picnic For Detectives
  that a pack of beagles was employed to frighten off swooping crows, magpies, gulls,
  and other scavenging creatures with beaks and wings. Nowadays, the beagles in the
  pack are bred specially in the Detectives'' Beagle Breeding Compound, their psychological
  state carefully monitored while they are still puppies.

  One innovation at the third Picnic For Detectives which did not survive was musical
  accompaniment. The experimental percussionist Zoltan Taplow was invited along, despite
  having no background in police work. He was stationed in a corner of the field and
  asked to play suitable picnic music. His energetic thumping upon reconditioned metal
  drums and shamanic gongs was drowned out that day by howling winds and the steady
  convoy of cement-mixer trucks growling along the road. There is one body of opinion
  which suggests that Taplow was merely a figment of the overheated imagination of
  one of the detectives, a tall, stooping forensics specialist who had spent too much
  of his career aboard ships. The absence of Taplow from nearly all A-Z directories
  of experimental percussionists tends to support this view.


  Shaman with gong

  The music, real or imagined, was inaudible. But the picnic itself was a triumph.
  It is the subject of two novels, a stage play, a long-running television serial,
  an opera, and no less than three films, the finest of which is probably Picnic For
  Detectives : Three, the title of which was changed to Hot Picnic For Detectives
  Impact by the distributors, concerned that cinemagoers would be confused into assuming
  they had missed two earlier features. Detective Captain Shuddery, who was given
  a sabbatical from the force to produce and direct the film, disowned it, but he
  need not have done, for it is a towering work. It may be that his critical faculties
  deserted him when, immediately after completing the film, he was badly injured when
  attacked by a swan. It is certainly true that his nerves never recovered, and he
  spent what ought to have been the prime of his career chewing toffee in the hothouse
  of a nursing home, surrounded by gigantic and abominable plants.

  By the time Shuddery''s film came out, that third Picnic For Detectives was lost
  in the past, a sepia-tinged memory of tweed suits, massive walrus moustaches, essence
  of violets, organdie ruffles, reticules and Gladstone bags. From the fourth year
  onwards, with the introduction of lobsters on the menu, Picnic For Detectives took
  on its startling calendrical significance. Who, today, can imagine a year in Hooting
  Yard without it?

  Remarkably little has changed over the years. Still, there is the ceremonial march-past
  of retired detectives on Picnic For Detectives Eve, where the wheelchairs of the
  infirm ancients are pushed along by teams of tots from Pang Hill Orphanage. Still,
  the lobster pots are made of beaten bronze in a factory far away. Still, the field
  is laced with buttercups and dandelions, and spurge allowed to spread. Still, anxious
  eyes are cast up to the skies in the morning, the weather discussed in almost insane
  detail by all who linger on the Pang Hill pathways. Still the hampers bear badges
  which glisten under their caking of mud. And still there are detectives. And still
  there is a picnic for them, in Hooting Yard, but once a year, come hell or high
  water, come rain or shine.

  ME AND MY HOMUNCULUS

  The "insane root" which Mrs Campbell Praed refers to in the above quotation is likely
  to be a mandrake. The bifurcated root of the plant resembles a human figure, or
  so people have thought throughout the ages. There is a legend that when the mandrake-person
  is pulled from the ground, it shrieks in pain, and this cry is able to madden, deafen
  or even kill an unprotected human being. One way of pulling a mandrake out of the
  ground safely is given as follows: "A furrow must be dug around the root until its
  lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which the person tying the
  dog must get away. The dog then endeavours to follow him, and so easily pulls up
  the root, but dies suddenly instead of his master. After this the root can be handled
  without fear."


  Being a miniature person, the mandrake root is thus a type of homunculus. The first
  homunculus was made by that old rascal Paracelsus out of a bag of bones, sperm,
  skin fragments and animal hair, these ingredients laid in the ground surrounded
  by horse manure for forty days, at which point the embryo formed. It seems likely
  that Paracelsus was making this up, as I tried it. I was looking forward to having
  a little homunculus running about the place, and was even thinking up a suitable
  name for it, but when I dug up the patch of manure there was no sign of any such
  being.

  The mandrake itself features in another homunculus "recipe". The root has to be
  picked before dawn on a Friday morning by a black dog, then washed and fed with
  milk, honey and blood. I was going to try this approach too, but I was unable to
  find a suitable dog.


  A particularly thrilling method of creating a homunculus was given by Dr David Christianus
  of Giessen in the eighteenth century. He suggested taking an egg laid by a black
  hen, poking a tiny hole through the shell, replacing a bean-sized portion of the
  white with human sperm, sealing the opening with virgin parchment, and burying the
  egg in dung on the first day of the March lunar cycle. Do this, he confidently announced,
  and after thirty days a miniature humanoid would emerge, which would help and protect
  its creator in return for a steady diet of lavender seeds and earthworms. I am going
  to have a bash at this method next March and will let readers know how I get on.


  BLODGETT''S FIENDISH X-RAY PLOT

  Some say Blodgett conceived his fiendish X-ray plot as revenge against a world that
  laughed at him because he was a short man, but they are wrong. Blodgett was not
  of diminutive stature. He was actually somewhere between six and seven feet tall,
  although it is hard to be precise because he was resistant to tape measures. They
  would become knotted or twisted or indeed simply burst into inexplicable flames
  when Blodgett was near. At a snap of his fingers, similar devices, such as rulers
  or yardsticks, would crumble to sawdust, if they were wooden, or just dust, if made
  of some other substance. Remember that Blodgett was a frightening, frightening man.

  He conceived his fiendish X-ray plot on a wild and windy Thursday just a week after
  Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays accidentally while studying cathode rays
  in a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube. Despite the fact that the tube was encased
  in a black cardboard box, Roentgen noticed that a barium platinocyanide screen,
  placed nearby by chance, emitted fluorescent light whenever the tube was in operation.
  Hearing the news on some sort of criminal grapevine, Blodgett immediately obtained
  a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube and a barium platinocyanide screen. He sent
  his minions fanning out around town to steal a black cardboard box, and this led
  to his undoing.

  A dishevelled plain clothes police officer, a protege of Chief Inspector Cargpan,
  apprehended one of Blodgett''s forty thieves trundling a stolen black cardboard
  box down a noisome alleyway in the small hours of the morning. The box was not empty.
  It contained a tangle of enraged and venomous vipers*. The game was up.

  Sometimes, when writing about failed criminal enterprises, one is tempted to embroider
  the bare facts in the interests of entertainment. Here, I am content to let the
  facts speak for themselves. They may not speak eloquently, but they speak, and that
  is enough, one hundred and ten years after the foiling of Blodgett''s fiendish X-ray
  plot.

  *NOTE : Tautology. All vipers possess envenomed fangs, apparently.


  A copperhead pit viper. Imagine lots of these in a stolen black cardboard box.'
