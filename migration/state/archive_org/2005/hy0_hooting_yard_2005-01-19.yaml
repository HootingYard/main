full_text: 'PAGEANTRY

  I am not averse to pageantry, so when a parade came past my door last Friday I went
  to my window to watch. Although the pane of glass in my window is besmirched by
  grease, I had a splendid view. I saw a yellow brougham, three green pantechnicons,
  a brown cabriolet, at least a dozen crimson charabancs, a pair of white phaetons,
  and a blue chariot, each with its flags and bunting and streamers and ribbons, some
  with hooters and klaxons making a terrible din, and they were followed by countless
  wagons and floats and cars, gigs, coaches, brakes, droshkys, jalopies and landaus,
  jeeps, bogies and coupes, drays, palanquins and flivvers, so many that before I
  knew it hours had passed, and it was dusk, and there seemed to be no end to the
  parade.

  I was beginning to wonder how I would be able to cross the street. I wanted to go
  to the tobacconists'' to pick up a twist of nap and a plug of slot, but the succession
  of carriages, decorative snowploughs, unicycles and troikas showed no sign of abating.
  The crowd that had gathered to cheer and throw hats in the air and dance impromptu
  polkas was thicker than it had been all day. One mountebank had set up his stall
  close to my front gate and was attracting custom with whoops and whistles.

  I decided to risk crossing the road, thinking I could weave my way through the parade.
  I put on my hat and stepped out of the door, and was at once caught up in a surging
  mob of revellers and borne aloft like some sort of mascot. They ignored my tremulous
  whimpers of protest, but eventually dumped me on the kerb about a mile down the
  road from my house, and here the pageantry, and crowds, were if anything more boisterous,
  colourful and noisy than ever.

  "What is this all in aid of?" I shouted at a black-clad widow-woman who was selling
  bundles of strange herbs from a barrow. She was reluctant to answer me until I had
  forked out a handful of cash for a sprig of irkbane.

  "A potentate from a far distant land is visiting our town," she told me, "and the
  council wanted to make him welcome. He is a terrible tyrant, and he has been known
  to kill a horse just by uttering its name. His palace is bigger than the tallest
  mountain, and is built from the bones of enemies he has slain in combat. But they
  say that in his bailiwick sheep may safely graze."

  The crone continued to speak, but she was drowned out by a band of pipers on the
  back of a passing flatbed truck. I stuffed cotton wool into my ears. An urchin pressed
  a pennant into my hand and I found myself waving it unthinkingly. Night had fallen
  now, but the town was bright with flares and gas and calcium night lights. I stood
  at the roadside, hemmed in by carousing crowds, and watched the passing parade.

  Somewhere bells were clanging. A mile away, in the dark dark woods, owls swooped
  on field mice, badgers grubbed for worms, and insects glowed. A mile further on,
  the potentate''s assassin tied a bandanna around his head, lit a cigarillo, shouldered
  his rifle and began his heavy deliberate trudge across the marshes towards the town.


  ON GODS

  Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. These are gods. They are not toys or trinkets, plastic
  figurines or dolls made out of scraps of wool or straw. They are gods. Maat. Aten.
  Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. These too are gods. Mighty, imperious gods. Geb is the Great
  Cackler, Hapi the Father of the Gods, Anubis the Jackal, Khnum the Lord of the Cool
  Waters, Ra the Sun God, Maat the Goddess of Truth, Aten the Lord of All, Sekhmet
  the Mighty One, Hathor the Mistress of Heaven and Horus He Who Is Above. Bow down
  before them for they are powerful deities. While you cower in your ditch, grovelling,
  they bestride the heavens. Not toys, I say, but gods. Ammut. Isis. Bastet. Nut.
  Ptah. The devourer, the throne, the tearer, the sky, the opener. Above you the sky
  is black and fat with stars, for it is night, illimitable and desolate, and you
  are an uncomprehending mite alone on a burning planet, sprawling in your ditch.
  They are gods. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. Big, towering, potent gods
  and goddesses. Aker the Double Lion God. Khepri He who comes into existence. Sobek
  He who causes fertility. Taurt the Great Lady. Seshat, ah Seshat, the Lady of the
  Library, and Seth the Lord of Upper Egypt. These are the gods. You are not in Upper
  Egypt, nor in Lower Egypt. You are not in Egypt at all. But wherever your ditch
  is, in this night as hard as iron, you abase yourself before these gods, because
  you must. The time for toys and trinkets, for the bauble and the gewgaw, is long
  past, and you have left all fripperies behind you. Now there is simply you and your
  gods, locked together, in the face of the stark blank sky. Min. Mut. Osiris. Amun.
  Nephthys. Neith. The Chief of Heaven, the Lady of Heaven, the King of the Dead,
  the Hidden One, the Lady of the House and the Great Goddess. Bow down, bow down.
  You have a forelock. It is there to be tugged, so tug it. Tug it in obeisance to
  Thoth, the Great Measurer. And to Ra, to Ra, to Ra!

  Now plant your brow in the muck on the floor of the ditch and cast your mind back
  to that golden happy childhood when you plashed in the paddling pool on a sun-blazed
  summer''s day. The water was cool and delightful, the water in your paddling pool.
  Did you rush home wrapped in your big yellow towel and worship Khnum? Did you thank
  Khnum for the coolness of the water? Dried and cooled, did you clutch your library
  ticket in your tiny hand and scamper excitedly to the public lending library to
  borrow a book of fairy stories? You would have looked for something with pictures
  of elves and wizards and peris and hobgoblins, and found a compendium, perhaps,
  carried it on tippytoe to the issuing desk bathed in the glorious sunshine streaming
  through those enormous library windows, had it stamped, and borne your borrowed
  book away, out onto the path in the bright afternoon. When you got home, safe in
  your bedroom strewn with pillows and cushions and patchwork quilts and throws, did
  you cry out in gratitude to Seshat?

  Mut. Nut. Horus. Seth. Anubis. These are gods. All-powerful and eternal. I can picture
  you, a few summers later, older but no wiser, traipsing around in the park at lunchtime.
  You have a bag of breadcrumbs and you intend to cast them upon the grass as food
  for sparrows and magpies and starlings, for linnets and ravens, for bufflehead ducks
  and grebes. Sitting on the rusty bench with its rusty plaque in memory of one long
  dead who sat here often and adored the view, the view of rooftops and chimneys and
  football fields and allotments, of tennis courts and orchards rich in cherry trees,
  I see you casting your crumbs to the birds, and I know that you are not giving thanks
  to Aten or Geb or Sekhmet or Ptah. No. Still at this time, despite your riches and
  your bravura, your poor head is filled with visions of Itzpapalotl, Coatlicue, Temazcalteci,
  Tlaloc, Mayahual, Cihuateto, Huixtocihuatl, Popocatepetl and the like, for these
  are your gods. In the grip of your delusions, it is perhaps not coincidental that
  you like to sport a yellow polo neck sweater like the one worn by Christopher Lee
  in The Wicker Man, and even have your hair cut in a similar mop, though you are
  not yet going grey, and you insist that you have not seen the film, for you profess
  a devotion to the silent screen. In your pantheon, Abel Gance rubs shoulders with
  Oxomoco, Lilian Gish with Quetzalcoatl. You have seen Broken Blossoms more than
  a dozen times, and sometimes you like to pace the back streets of Limehouse as if
  in search of the opium dens that are no longer there, the dens from which Sherlock
  Holmes emerged twitching and shattered in The Man With The Twisted Lip. Those fog-enshrouded
  days are as distant now as the bright summers of your paddling pool youth, yet you
  cling to your false gods as you feed the birds and ducks in the park, shaded from
  Nut''s glittering sky by the overhanging branches of sycamores and hazel trees,
  on the bench by the magnificent iron railings which were replaced after the war
  in which you were wounded thrice. You were shot in the stomach, burned by flaming
  barrels, and crushed by falling masonry, but now there is not a scratch on you,
  and you have forgotten that terrible day in Scheveningen. You were treated well
  in the field hospital, but what did you do, once you could again use your hands?
  You scavenged scraps of wood and built a little toy altar and put it on your bedside
  shelf, praying to Ixtlilton, your god of healing, for having saved you from the
  realm of Mictlantecuhtle.

  So let us spring forward again now, another ten, twenty years, and now your hair
  is grey, but no longer cut a la Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man. Your yellow polo
  neck is threadbare now, and you use it as a dust-cloth. There is much dust in your
  home, for the air is never still there. Draughts curl in under the doors and around
  the window frames, for much of the wood is rotting away under sustained attack by
  weevils and woodworms, microscopic forms of life you have ignored for too long.
  Baleful, greasy, plump, a little cracked, you shuffle from room to room, pointlessly,
  as if you have been kennelled. All your money is gone, exhausted by your postwar
  debaucheries. You have a blighted reputation and constant pins and needles. That
  is what accounts for your restlessness, this shuffling from bedroom to pantry to
  parlour to outhouse, from attic to cellar, and back again, up and down and round
  and round and always with your liver-spotted fist clamped around a little tin medallion
  of Montezuma as if that might fend off the night, the darkness, the vastness of
  eternity. You have a kitten, but it hates you. You have not yet been subjugated
  by Bastet, but that time is drawing nigh. So you call your kitten Karen Carpenter
  and feed it with fish that you pluck from ponds, or with eels you thieve from the
  back-kitchens of canteens, and your kitten hisses at you and claws you and loathes
  the sight of you. You are fearful of the light in those green eyes, for you rightly
  sense that they see into your soul, your small and puny soul, all curdled by a life
  of waste and delusion that Centeotl would bring you corn, that Chantico would warm
  your hearth, that the wind cried Ehecatl. The gods are in readiness for you and
  the wind is cold.

  Yes, it is night now, and you are in your ditch. The wind is cold and the sky is
  black and there are no birds, not even crows. Your kitten tore that pitiful tin
  medallion from your hand and dropped it down a well. You are alone, but for the
  gods. Geb. Hapi. Anubis. Khnum. Ra. You have sunk to your knees. That blurred black
  and white image of Lilian Gish, stricken by panic in The Wind, is fading fast. Like
  Sherlock Holmes, you too are twitching and shattered, but no opiates brought you
  to this. Maat. Aten. Sekhmet. Hathor. Horus. There is no longer any traffic, no
  car horns, no rattling carts, no clanking steamer plying across the strait. Despite
  your wealth, you never did fly in an aeroplane across oceans and continents. You
  never did go and live in that house on stilts that you pictured in your mind''s
  eye when you were young. Parks and ponds were your domain, parks and ponds. And
  now this ditch, a trickle of foul brackish water running through it. You cup some
  in your hands and splash it on your burning brow but it is not the cool water from
  the paddling pool given to you by Khnum all those years ago. Ammut. Isis. Bastet.
  Nut. Ptah. Aker. Khepri. Sobek. Taurt. Seshat. Seth. There came that day, that Thursday,
  when your nerves were so brittle and the pins and needles became too much, and you
  flung your Montezuma medallion across the pantry and cursed your gods, and the kitten
  crept up to you and fixed its green eyes on you. You retrieved your tin gewgaw and
  fled to the park to watch the grebes, but you were shaken. You have not been still
  since then, you are like the gusts of air swirling around your house, the house
  you lived in then. Min. Mut. Osiris. Amun. Nephthys. Neith. These are the gods.
  And Ra. And Anubis. And Thoth, the Great Measurer, Thoth who is ready to take your
  measure now. Be still. Be measured. Be still.


  ONE AFTERNOON ON THE LANE THAT RUNS FROM COCTLOSH TO POINTY TOWN

  It was a sweltering day, and I had spent a profitable hour or two rummaging in the
  market square at Coctlosh. My haversack was filled with purchases, including aniseed
  and bleach and curd, a dark enticing flap, gewgaws, a hat, iced and jellied kiwi
  fruit lozenges, mayonnaise and more items from the first half of the alphabet. Making
  my way home along the lane that runs from Coctlosh to Pointy Town, I passed again
  the bench where that morning I had encountered the Victorian Jesuit poet Gerard
  Manley Hopkins. I told you about that meeting on Tuesday 7th December last year.

  Father Hopkins was no longer sitting on the bench. His place had been taken by a
  bespectacled chap with a high forehead. At a glance, I took him to be a man of powerful
  intellect.

  "Good afternoon," I said jauntily, tipping my hat.

  "Cat''s foot iron claw. Neurosurgeons scream for more at paranoia''s poison door,"
  he shouted.

  "I beg your pardon?" I asked, disconcerted.

  "Twenty-first century schizoid man!" he bellowed.

  To my great excitement, it dawned on me that I was talking to cerebral pop god Robert
  Fripp. I had not been mistaken when I judged my interlocutor to be a man of great
  intellectual accomplishment.

  "I am thrilled to meet you," I babbled, "For you are the man who managed to have
  an electric guitar technique named Frippertronics after you, even though others
  had developed it and used it long before. That shows chutzpah!"

  "Blood rack barbed wire," he replied, "Politicians'' funeral pyre. Innocents raped
  with napalm fire. Twenty-first century schizoid man."

  I tossed him a plum as I pondered the deep significance of his words. I treasured
  this moment. How rarely we find ourselves in the presence of genius, rarer still
  to meet genius, chutzpah, round spectacles and pop immortality commingled in one
  man. I was hanging on his every word.

  "Death seed blind man''s greed," he roared. I hastily scribbled it down in my notebook.

  "Poets'' starving children bleed," he continued, as I gazed at him, awestruck. The
  afternoon sun glistened on his spectacle lenses and shiny high forehead.

  "Nothing he''s got he really needs. Twenty-first century schizoid man," he growled,
  and with that he jumped up from the bench and hared off down the lane. Sadly, he
  had ignored my gift of a plum, but I did not let that spoil my glow of contentment.
  I walked briskly home to listen to my much-treasured CD of Toyah Wilcox''s Greatest
  Hits.


  BOGODAN

  Bogodan, Bogodan, who will speak for Bogodan? I will speak for Bogodan. I will be
  Bogodan''s mouthpiece. I will say what I think Bogodan wants me to say. Something
  like: "There are cows in the field and trees at its edge, I think they are larches,
  and that is a hedge." When I say "that" I will point, decisively, or, no, not decisively,
  but with a trembling finger, as if I am the terrified protagonist of a piece of
  spooky fiction encountering the ghost of one long dead. Then I will look back at
  Bogodan to make sure I have said what he would say in the circumstances, if he but
  had a voice to speak with.

  Bogodan has been called my familiar. He is tiny and grey and flits. The air around
  him is chill, but not unpleasantly so. He wears a little cap, like a cadet in a
  small Mittel-European army. He smokes Disque Bleu to give himself, I surmise, a
  sophisticated sheen, but the linings of his lungs are paper thin and I fear for
  his health.

  What will become of me without Bogodan? Did you know that there is a special place
  for people who have been abandoned by their familiars? It is not a pretty place,
  despite the fact that mirrored there are the cows, larch trees and hedges of our
  own world, almost identical but that they are all covered in ectoplasm. Would I,
  too, if deserted by Bogodan, experience the world through a refulgent film of white
  goo? Now there''s a thought.'
