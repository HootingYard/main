full_text: 'WISPS AND CLUMPS

  Today I am going to talk to you--at you--about wisps and clumps. Gaining an insight
  into wisps and clumps will not give you a complete understanding of the physical
  universe in all its matchless wonder, but it is a start. Indeed I can think of few
  subjects which prove a better introduction. Some might talk to you of toads or gazelles
  or coconut matting, perhaps, or of strange irrefragible lights in the maritime skies,
  but I stick to wisps and clumps, with occasional forays into bee world.

  So, then, what is a wisp and what is a clump? We shall look at each in turn. A wisp
  might be made of smoke or some other fume, for there are countless fumes, gaseous
  and otherwise. One guaranteed way of seeing a wisp with your very own eyes is to
  stand next to a dying bonfire. If you go and stand there too early, while the bonfire
  is still blazing, perhaps with an effigy of Roman Catholic martyr Guy Fawkes engulfed
  in the flames, you will not be able to see any wisps, or much else, because the
  smoke will be billowing, making your eyes water, and if some scamp has placed any
  noxious substances on the bonfire, such as anything made of rubber or plastic, things
  will be even worse, and you may feel like choking, indeed you may even choke uncontrollably,
  and topple to the ground, helpless, helpless, helpless, as Crosby, Stills, Nash
  & Young were wont to sing, long ago, on the west coast of America. They say that
  David Crosby''s moustache is to be preserved as a national monument, but I digress.

  Basically, what I am saying is: keep away from the bonfire while it is at its height.
  You want to go and stand next to it as the last embers are dying, for it is then
  that you will be able to see wisps of smoke. What are their characteristics, these
  wisps? They are light, delicate, and fugitive. You will see a wisp rising from the
  glowing ashes, and it will slink upon the breeze for a few moments, and then it
  will be gone. All that is solid melts into air, according to Marx and Engels in
  The Manifesto Of The Communist Party (1848), and this is certainly true of wisps,
  which are hardly solid in the first place.

  Some substances take longer to melt into air than others, of course, and this brings
  us neatly to clumps. Clumps can be made of all sorts of things, and for the moment
  I want you to direct your attention to clumps of earth, or soil, or mud. Such clumps
  are often called clods (particularly by the visionary poet William Blake, who wrote
  The Clod And The Pebble) but I am sticking with clumps for the purpose of this diverting
  talk. At least I hope it is diverting.

  Now, there you were, standing next to the bonfire while it blazed, having arrived
  far too early for the wisps, and your eyes were streaming with tears and you were
  coughing and choking, helplessly, remember, and the next thing that happened was
  that you toppled over and fell to the ground, perhaps even rolling into a nearby
  ditch. Let us assume you are sprawled there, on your front, face down in the muck.
  At some point in the next few minutes, the effects of smoke inhalation wear off,
  and you open your stinging eyes. Chances are that the first thing you will see,
  there in the ditch, is a clump of earth. One glance at it should be enough to show
  you that it will take longer to melt into air than a wisp, but melt into air it
  shall, one day, as all solid things do.

  We examined the characteristics of the wisp, so we ought to do the same with the
  clump, but I have to say that I am reluctant to do so. I think it is worth celebrating
  the ephemeral and fugitive nature of wisps, much as one admires clouds, or falls
  of snow, or the all too brief life of a bee. But a clump is just a clump, really,
  a clump or clod, fit only to be kicked or squashed underfoot, crushed beneath the
  mighty boots of history.

  I do hope that you have gained a valuable insight into both wisps and clumps. If
  you wish to do any further reading, don''t bother with the King James Bible (the
  Authorised Version) as neither wisps nor clumps are mentioned in it, strangely enough.
  You may find a richer trove in Dobson''s pamphlet A Pamphlet About Wisps And Clumps,
  which I have plagiarised shamelessly in this talk. Bon soir, toodle-oo.


  ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LIGHTHOUSES

  It is with great pleasure that I have come to this charming--if windswept--seaside
  resort, at the invitation of the Dobson Memorial Lecture Organising Committee, to
  speak upon that most fascinating of topics, the administration of lighthouses. First
  of all, I must confess that it is a topic of which I am almost wholly ignorant.
  Ask me about ponds, or badgers, and I can rattle on like a maniac for days on end.
  But I have never even set foot in a lighthouse, and can think of no conceivable
  reason why I should ever want to. Much as I adore ponds, I am terrified of the sea,
  for the sea is a fearsome and horrible thing, progenitor of countless nightmares,
  a vast and unpitying force of nature, hideous to behold and murderous in its immensity.

  Still, I have promised to speak of lighthouses, and I am not a man to shy away from
  a challenge. As luck would have it, my oldest and dearest friend, the Reverend F.
  X. Heliogabalus, has spent the best part of his life engaged in the administration
  of lighthouses, and he has been kind enough to share with me some of the more thrilling
  details of his career.

  You may think it odd that an ordained clergyman, indeed a Jesuit, should devote
  his life to such a calling. Heliogabalus spends his days on horseback, galloping
  across the land from one lighthouse to another, his pipe clamped in his jaws and
  his catechism tucked into the pocket of his soutane. The man hardly knows the meaning
  of rest. Sometimes he will accept an invitation to sleep overnight when a kindly
  lighthouse keeper offers him a mattress upon which to sprawl, but more often this
  most driven of priests will ride his trusty steed through the night, careering with
  alarming speed along clifftop paths whose tempest-racked fences have been broken
  or uprooted, and where both man and horse are in constant danger of plunging hundreds
  of feet into the churning waters below.

  I beg your pardon. I must pause for a sip of milk of magnesia.

  What is Father Heliogabalus up to, charging from lighthouse to lighthouse? I have
  asked him this question many times, and he simply refuses to answer, merely clamping
  that pipe in his jaws and raising his eyebrows in a manner I find confoundedly vexing.
  Oh, there have been times when I have felt like dashing the man to the ground in
  a fit of deranged violence, but he is much stronger than me, and indeed much taller;
  at seven and a half feet in height, he is bigger than most people I have come across
  as I wend my way through life on this blissful and miraculous planet. But I digress.
  The invitation to give this talk prompted me to ask Heliogabalus once again about
  life as an administrator of lighthouses. I tracked him down to a filthy harbour
  south of Hooting Yard, where he was being forced to pause for a few days due to
  his horse having contracted lockjaw. Heliogabalus was curled up in a chair in the
  corner of the veterinarian''s waiting room. It was the kind of chair Michael Caine
  might have sat in in one of those mid-1960s films about swinging London. A number
  of sick animals--a badger among them, I was distressed to note--huddled together
  fearfully in the opposite corner of the room, staring wild-eyed at the Jesuit and
  every now and then emitting whimpers of abject terror.

  "I have this effect upon beasts of the field," said Heliogabalus, languid and unconcerned,
  "They regard me with dread, as well they might."

  I wondered whether to pursue this comment, and decided against it. I have said that
  Heliogabalus was my oldest friend, but I admit that there are times when he scares
  me fair out of my wits. As it was, I had no opportunity to say anything, as my old
  mucker continued to speak:

  "I understand that you wish to know something of my lighthouse administration activities,
  Key," he sneered, "Otherwise you will suffer humiliation when called upon to speak
  of the subject at some godforsaken seaside resort. Is that correct?"

  He did not wait for a reply, but--his voice growing louder, and causing the pitiable
  assortment of ailing badgers, stoats, hedgehogs, lampreys, pigs, cormorants, axolotls
  and bison to start up a soul-wrenching cacophony of squealing, hissing, whining
  and other, indescribable noises--he stood up, towering over me, and thundered:

  "Imagine a world, Key, a Godless world, bereft of divine order, in which each lighthouse
  keeper is allowed to do as he or she wishes. Picture them, hundreds, nay, thousands
  of lighthouses, each running to its own timetable, each setting its lights flashing
  and rotating and signalling and whatnot whenever the keeper feels like it. What
  is the result? Chaos, pure and simple! Chaos leading to shipwrecks, tugboat accidents,
  buoy disasters, general nautical mayhem and the Lord knows what other kinds of marine
  catastrophe. Is that the world you wish to inhabit? Eh? You would be no better off
  than one of these sickly beasts here"--he gestured violently towards a tiny hummingbird
  with a stab wound on its head which was trying to hide behind the veterinarian''s
  chaise longue--"these foul beasts which quiver and quake at my every word. No, that
  is not the world we wish to live in. In our world--in God''s world--we must make
  sure that lighthouse keepers do their work according to a plan. I carry in my saddlebags
  a thumping great book of over nine hundred pages. It is a manual of lighthouse administration.
  I have memorised every word in that book, Key. Indeed, though it pains me to say
  it, I know it better than I know my Bible. So as I traverse this evil land astride
  my sick and neglected horse, I go from lighthouse to lighthouse to ensure that the
  keepers are following the rules laid down in the manual. And if they stray from
  its commands, I smite them.

  "Think not, Key, that the commands are onerous. Most of them are simply common sense.
  But the devil works to undermine the sensible workings of each and every lighthouse.
  I have seen with my own eyes, for example, a lighthouse keeper of many years'' experience
  failing to sharpen his pencil over a wastepaper basket. Does he not know that wood-shavings
  are a cause of fire? That by his actions he could burn down his lighthouse in a
  matter of minutes? Again, I have seen a lighthouse keeper using a frayed rope to
  tie his boat to his jetty. It is barely imaginable!"

  Such was his excitement that Heliogabalus began to hurl pieces of cutlery at the
  cowering animals.

  "Tell me, " I ventured, "Do you just call round to these lighthouses and declaim
  instructive passages from your manual?"

  "Why, no," he replied, chucking a sugar spoon at a weasel, "I am not a harsh man.
  While in one saddlebag I keep the manual with which to strike terror into the hearts
  of ingrates and backsliders, in my other saddlebag I carry a selection of useful
  supplies, the items the keepers do not receive in their regular hampers from the
  lighthouse equipment warehouse. I bring them things such as gigantic rolls of blotting
  paper, hard-boiled eggs steeped in maple syrup, specially darned flags from every
  continent, buckets filled with a solution for the removal of dried ink from hair,
  reticules for the blind, nozzles to be attached to burst cartons -"

  At this point the veterinary surgeon entered the room to announce that the Jesuit''s
  horse was fully recovered. Heliogabalus took my hand, and nearly crushed it in bidding
  me farewell. Within seconds he was gone, galloping away to administer his peculiar
  justice tempered with mercy to the lighthouse keepers of the land. I am glad I am
  not one of them.


  CEMETERY BIRDS

  In Tantarabim, the lopwit is known as the Cemetery Bird. By law, all graveyards
  in that land are situated at the seaside, so one might expect gulls or guillemots
  or other seabirds to be most associated with the tombstones. Yet it is the lopwit,
  small, tufted, brightly-coloured, that is invoked in the funeral practices of the
  people of Tantarabim. Why?

  As so often, we can turn to the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson to help us answer
  this question. It is true that, throughout his copious writings, he never addressed
  the subject directly. True, too, that his knowledge of ornithology was paltry and
  lamentable, and more often than not wholly inaccurate. With Dobson, it is a case
  of knowing where to look. We will not find a pamphlet called Why They Call The Lopwit
  The Cemetery Bird In Tantarabim, but now, with the long overdue publication of Aloysius
  Nestingbird''s Mighty Concordance Dobsoniana, we know that the answer to the question
  can be pieced together from a number of sources. There is that impertinent little
  footnote in An Essay About Bowls, Dishes And Pots. There is a majestic, sweeping
  paragraph in A Pamphlet Of Majestic Sweeping Paragraphs. There is a ham-fisted pencil
  drawing in the appendix to Why I Smashed My Copy Of "Thick As A Brick" By Jethro
  Tull Into Twenty Thousand Pieces With A Geological Hammer And Then Glued It Back
  Together Again. And, of course, there are the famous lines hidden away in Dobson''s
  so-called Uberpamphlet, in which he writes:

  "Lopwits flock to the seaside cemeteries of Tantarabim in search of spurge and sukebind.
  They munch these plants greedily, if one can use the word munch to describe the
  way they tear savagely at the foliage with their beaks and swallow each beakful
  whole, having no teeth, for I can now reveal that, in common with other birds, lopwits
  are innocent of teeth. Would that I could say the same of myself."

  Commentators have long been amused at Dobson''s presumption in claiming to be the
  first person in history to point out that birds do not have teeth. Less remarked
  is the fact that he is completely wrong about the lopwits'' diet. These birds--which
  are small, tufted, and brightly-coloured, as we have seen--eat neither spurge nor
  sukebind. If they did so, they would surely die of poisoning, for they do not produce
  the enzymes necessary to break down and digest these particular plants. You can
  look that up in the most basic encyclopaedia of avian digestive systems. Who knows
  why Dobson could not be bothered to do so?


  The propellers on the aeroplanes in the airfield across the road are making a terrible
  racket and I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I think I will cram some cotton
  wool into my ears.


  Dobson would often bang on about his devotion to research. It made him something
  of a trying companion, for it was not beyond him to regale a tavern''s worth of
  peasants with a harangue. "Do you people realise," he might shout, apropos of nothing,
  "That before writing my pamphlet entitled Notes On A Shelf Of Test Tubes Containing
  The Blood Of Squirrels I read fourteen different encyclopaedias from cover to cover,
  together with the collected works of Emily Dickinson, T Lobsang Rampa, and Harold
  Pinter?" Of course, in remarks such as these--which have been reported to us by
  Marigold Chew and others--Dobson unwittingly makes clear that his understanding
  of "research" is, to put it kindly, somewhat witless. If he genuinely intended to
  say anything meaningful about the blood of squirrels, what perverse impulse would
  make him think he could find any useful material in, say, the works of a grumpy
  bespectacled north London misanthrope? And yet this was always the way he worked,
  with his magpie mind, to the despair of some and the delight of others. That is
  why this new Concordance will prove such a boon to scholars. If you want to know
  what Dobson had to say about the cemetery birds of Tantarabim, there is no point
  looking in any of the eighty-nine pamphlets which mention birds in the title, nor
  in either of the two monographs on Tantarabim-related topics which Dobson wrote
  while holed up in that milk of magnesia warehouse in Winnipeg. Similarly, should
  you want to discover what the great pamphleteer had to say about obsolete punctuation
  marks, it may come as some surprise to find that there are at least twenty pages
  of pertinent remarks in the virtually forgotten early pamphlet Observations On Cows
  From A Great Distance, In The Rain.

  Speaking of cows, it is worth mentioning here that in addition to the seaside cemeteries
  with their allotted lopwits, there was, in old Tantarabim, a single inland cemetery,
  far from the sea, known as the Graveyard of Cows. On this occasion we need not consult
  Dobson, for the story is well known. Cows grazed in the Graveyard of Cows, to keep
  down the grass, and when they died, the same cows were buried there. The mezzotintist
  and amateur historian of Tantarabim, Rex Tint, unearthed a mezzotint which showed
  the big signboard which stood at the graveyard gates, and translated the notice
  engraved thereon:

  "Hey there, passer-by in the day or night, stop now! Rest your weary legs and know
  that ye stand at the gates of the Graveyard of Cows. This plot of land was given
  in perpetuity to cows alive and cows dead by order of the Grand Plenipotentiary
  Vizier of Old Tantarabim according to visions which beset him as he knelt in his
  hanging gardens pruning his laburnums. No laburnums must grow in the grounds of
  the Graveyard of Cows, nor cinquefoil, nor rhubarb, nor lupins. Nay, thou shalt
  find in this field only towering hollyhocks among the grass, and cows feeding upon
  the grass, and the cows shall feed upon the grass among the hollyhocks of these
  fields until such time as they perish. And each time a graveyard cow leaves this
  mortal world, six villagers shall come unto here and use big spades to dig for that
  cow a grave beneath the grass. Two villagers shall be named Ned. Two shall be blind.
  One shall wear the hat of Boohoocha. And one shall be a puny person. And they shall
  dig the grave for the cow in the night time, under a black and starless sky, and
  bury the cow by morning. Now move on, traveller, wherever you are bound, but remember
  always the cows of Tantarabim as long as you ever shall live."


  UKRAINIAN POSTAGE STAMP BEES

  The nights are drawing in and soon we shall all be looking for pastimes to entertain
  us through the long winter evenings. As ever, Hooting Yard is delighted to bring
  you some marvellously exciting but little-known parlour games, and we begin with
  the traditional Ukrainian bee-counting game.


  Print out copies of the above picture sufficient for every member of the family.
  Everyone is given one copy of the bee stamps picture, a sheet of paper, and a pencil.
  In alphabetical order by name, each player takes it in turn to count the number
  of bees, large and small. While they are counting, everyone else must stay still
  and not say a word. The counting player finishes by writing their name and the number
  of bees they have counted on their sheet of paper, folds it in half twice, and places
  it in the pot, which can be an upturned hat, or a cauldron, or some similar container.
  Then the next player counts the bees, and so on, until there are as many pieces
  of folded paper in the pot as there are players. One family member is then nominated
  to take the papers from the pot, put them in an envelope, affix a postage stamp,
  and address the envelope to the local Official Bee Counting Person. Remember to
  write your return address on the back of the envelope. A second player is then nominated
  to go out into the dark night, wild with gales, and pop the envelope into the nearest
  post box. While they are gone, the remaining players place the bee pictures in a
  neat pile and tidy away the pencils. Some weeks later, the Official Bee Counting
  Person will send the result, giving a definitive tally of the number of bees, large
  and small, in the picture, and announcing which player got closest to the correct
  total. The winner is allowed to choose another bee picture for the next round.'
