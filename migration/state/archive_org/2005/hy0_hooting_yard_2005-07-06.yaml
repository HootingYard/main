full_text: 'HOW TO ... FESTOON YOURSELF WITH OLD NETTING

  Serial Hooting Yard complainant Ruth Pastry writes : "The trouble with your website,
  Mr Key, is that, jam-packed as it is with arcane learning, those of us of a more
  practical bent are left short-changed. Apart from the occasional recipe, I find
  little here that teaches me how to actually do anything. Sort it out!"

  Well then. Here, especially for Ms Pastry, is the first in a series of How To...
  articles which have been written for us by the Barry Bucknell de nos jours, Fatima
  Gilliblat.

  Here is a surefire way to festoon yourself with old netting. First, buy a train
  ticket to the seaside, or more precisely to a fishing port, the more Lovecraftian
  the better. Innsmouth would be ideal, but anywhere faintly sinister and maritime
  will do. As soon as you arrive, sidle insouciantly down to the quayside, looking
  out for grizzled old fisherfolk. They may eye you with suspicion, but that is because
  you are a landlubber unfamiliar with the lore of the sea. Strike up a conversation.
  Ask questions about their "catch". At some point, while sucking on his clay pipe
  or picking the bones of sprats out of his matted hair, your interlocutor will mention
  his fishing net. This is your chance! Ask to see his net. Squelch across the sands
  with him when the tide is out, past the algae-smeared buoys and the rotting tugboats,
  and when you come to the old frayed net, slip the sea dog a fiver. He will trudge
  off to buy lugworms or maggots with this unexpected booty, and while he is gone,
  you can wrap yourself up in the net. Be sure to disentangle yourself and head back
  to the jetty before the tide comes in, or you will meet a watery doom, and miss
  the train home.


  TAKE ME BACK TO OLD PLOVDIV

  This piece first appeared in August 2004. I am posting it again for the simple reason
  that now, thanks to the indefatigable Salim Fadhley, it can be accompanied by a
  photograph, and thus be truly inspiring...

  I am suffering from a spiritual malaise. I am soul sick. I have not eaten any breakfast.
  I need to darn a hole in the sleeve of my jumper, but I have no further wool that
  matches. I feel inconsequential and abandoned and remote. My cheeks blush furiously
  with an embarrassment born of pity. Every last pencil I have is blunt. I am being
  driven crackers by my landlord''s drooling hound. My senses are atrophied, like
  a muscle unexercised. Pots and pans are strewn haphazardly in my kitchen. My legs
  have given way. I have an evil taste in my mouth. Hope is something for other people,
  not for me. My teapot is cracked and the cosy is stained and threadbare. Nervous
  spasms contort my features. I keep to the shadows if I have to move in the street.
  Do you hear that sound? It is my groan of despair. I have extinguished all the lanterns
  and I know in my cold, base heart that they will never be lit again. The air is
  heavy with menace and all I can hear is the screaming of desolation and ruin. Insects
  swarm about my face but I cannot summon the energy to swat them away. I have sprained
  my ankle. Dust lies everywhere, ashes and dust. Desire, ah, desire for me is not
  even a memory. Feral cats hiss at me and extend their claws. Even my poultry is
  contaminated. All sense of urgency is lost and yet I cannot relax. My head is swimming.
  My shoes let in rainwater and my socks are soaking wet. The washbasin is cracked.
  The taps no longer work. Even the most innocent and cherubic children spit at me.
  I gag on my own wretchedness. And then with a mighty effort, I pull myself up, and
  I trudge across Bulgaria like a whipped cur, and I go the Central Post Office building
  in Plovdiv, and I look at Georgi Bozhilov''s mural. Yes, that Georgi Bozhilov, whose
  nickname was Slona, or Elephant, a member of the so-called Plovdiv Fivesome. I gaze
  at the post office mural and somehow I am pulled back from the brink, and I embrace
  life again, wholeheartedly, blissfully. Here... here is a photograph of the mural,
  so you too can gaze upon it, and experience revelation!



  KNITTED BULGARIAN FOLK TALE PUPPET

  Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us readers
  a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that Olympics logo.
  Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial conclave, and
  to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed Blunkettite. The
  real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate to find out what Mrs
  Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?

  Well, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by
  a charity working with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels
  out Pointy Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower
  than the lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even
  the most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because, you
  know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for them,
  and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts--if they actually have
  beating human hearts--by making for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo, hero
  of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.

  We have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would be
  an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh,
  some three years after they originally appeared:

  Ugo Goofs Off

  Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. "There you go, Ugo, goofing off
  again," said Ugo''s ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on his
  boots. "Ma, I''ve got goo on my boots," said Ugo. Ugo''s ma gave him a rag to wipe
  the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags. Ugo''s ma
  was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened the drawer
  of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a gewgaw, for if
  she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn''t get the goo off his boots, but with a rag he
  would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the goo off his boots with
  a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pal Ulf

  In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo, Ugo,"
  said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma made him
  a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf''s bubo. In
  the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo''s ma brought
  food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. "Far be
  it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo''s ma, "But you should put the pancake
  on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo
  was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could
  cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could do. For the
  time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pod

  In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo''s ma said, "Ugo,
  why are you using a pod instead of a jar?" Ugo''s ma was blind, but she knew that
  the plop of Ugo''s pod was different to the plop of his jar. "Oh, ma," said Ugo,
  "My jar is in the shed." Ugo''s ma bashed Ugo on the head. "Never leave your jar
  in the shed, Ugo," she said, "When you do I will bash you on the head, as I just
  did." Ugo said, "Sorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed." "Ah," said Ugo''s
  ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s New Hooter

  Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his
  blind ma''s ear. "Ooh, Ugo," said Ugo''s ma, "That hooter makes a din!" "It''s a
  hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize," said Ugo. "And what did your pal Ulf win,
  Ugo?" asked Ugo''s ma, shelling peas as she spoke. "Ulf won a toy wolf, ma," said
  Ugo, "It''s as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb
  on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars." Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran
  off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Turns Blue

  It was Saint Hector''s Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo''s hood got snagged on
  a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. "Oooo" said Ugo''s
  pal Ulf, "Ugo, you look all blue." "Ack" said Ugo. "I''ll go and fetch your blind
  ma, Ugo, to see what she can do," said Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo''s hood
  off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found
  Ugo''s ma sitting on a stool. "Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "Ugo has turned blue. His hood
  is snagged on a tack." Ugo''s ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool
  and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo''s ma spat out her chew, and it landed
  in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo''s pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo''s ma unsnagged
  Ugo''s hood from the tack. "Ack" said Ugo. "Ooo, Ugo''s ma, I knew you would know
  what to do," said Ulf. Ugo''s ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon, and confiscated
  his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass. At Saint Hector''s
  Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Goes Loopy

  One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the
  yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo''s
  blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started to
  sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo''s ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a goose!"
  Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo''s pal Ulf, who came tumbling
  into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that you, Ugo''s
  pal Ulf?" asked Ugo''s ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is a shrew and a
  goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo''s ma. "No, Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "It''s only
  Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo''s ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo''s pal Ulf off to
  school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.


  BRONCHITIS PERSON''S HELICOPTER JOURNEY

  "Hand me that gewgaw," said the Mullah.

  The Mufti snatched the gewgaw from the Ayatollah and handed it to the Mullah.

  "Are you going to take the gewgaw to the Grand Vizier?" asked the Mufti.

  "That I am," said the Mullah, turning on the heel of his floppy bootee, and exiting
  through a rich brocade curtain.

  The Ayatollah stroked his tremendous hairy beard and looked at the Mufti.

  "Do you have your portable metal tapping machine on you?" he asked, and on seeing
  the Mufti nod, he added, "I want you to contact the Muezzin."

  "The Muezzin?" cried the Mufti, dumbfounded.

  "The same," said the Ayatollah.

  Leaving the Mufti to tap a message to the Muezzin, the Ayatollah went out into the
  courtyard. Almost hidden behind the luxuriant mimosa, japonica, candytuft, madder,
  lupins and oxlip, a whirring robot version of Big Bill Broonzy was playing the blues.
  The Ayatollah was tolerant of music, so long as it was mournful. He sat down on
  a mat and ran his fingers through his hairy beard again.

  Meanwhile, at the Grand Vizier''s palace, the Grand Vizier was impatiently awaiting
  the Mullah with the gewgaw. Last week he had volunteered to undergo ideological
  re-education. All the talk in the palace now was of the correct application of Mao
  Tse-Tung thought. The Grand Vizier wanted the Mullah''s gewgaw to add to his collection
  of baubles, the significance of which was only now beginning to dawn on him. He
  popped a filbert into his mouth and continued pacing up and down on his big and
  attractive carpet, his impatience growing.

  Just as the Ayatollah was stroking his superb hairy beard for the umpteenth time,
  the Mufti joined him in the courtyard. The Mufti had an abnormal growth on his forehead.

  "Strikingly disconcerting news," he announced, "The Muezzin has bronchitis."

  The Ayatollah let go of his beard.

  "Disconcerting indeed," he said, "Go and switch off the Broonzy robot. I need a
  bit of peace and quiet to think."

  In January, the remote control device for the robot had been left out in the rain,
  and no one had been able to repair it, so the Mufti had to fight his way through
  lilac, phlox, cotoneaster, hollyhocks and erica to reach the knob on the side of
  the machine to switch it off. Now the only sound in the courtyard was the insistent
  call of a corncrake far far away.

  Suddenly the Ayatollah ceased cogitating and spoke.

  "Mufti," he said, "There is a helicopter idling on the helipad. Go to it, fetch
  the Muezzin, then fly him to the Grand Vizier''s palace. That is my clearly considered
  plan of how we should proceed."

  And so the scene was set for that historic meeting in the palace, when the Grand
  Vizier, the Mullah, the bronchial Muezzin and the Mufti sat on divans in the room
  of baubles, their attentions fixed upon the gewgaw. Rex Tint''s mezzotint of the
  occasion, a work of the imagination, for of course he was not present, is one of
  his greatest mezzotints. It took him four years to complete it, and when it was
  done, he gave it as a gift to the Ayatollah, who framed it and hung it on the wall
  of the courtyard, where it was soon obscured by burgeoning fleabane, veronica, eglantine,
  hibiscus, poppies and daisies and lady''s slipper and old man''s beard, by saxifrage
  and narcissus, by orchids, by briars, by creeping jenny and viola, and it hangs
  there still, though the Ayatollah is long dead, and the faraway corncrake is no
  more.


  THE GROIST

  What is the Groist? Throughout the centuries, or to be more specific, in the summer
  of 1127, during most of March 1784, and last week, human beings have asked this
  question. And I should be specific about those human beings too, root and branch.
  I am not entirely sure that "root and branch" means anything in that last sentence,
  but it slipped out, soup to nuts, as did "soup to nuts", just then. This is what
  thinking about the Groist does, it seems, love in a mist and toffee apples. I am
  going to stop referring back, chimes at midnight, to the otherwise irrelevant phrases
  creeping in to this serious attempt to explain to readers what the, force majeure,
  Groist is, or was, or will be, or all three, throughout the years, on this delightful
  planet of ours, Henry.

  So picture yourself for a moment as a twelfth century peasant scrubbling around
  in your accustomed muck. Feel that smock. Your hair will as likely as not be matted,
  unwashed, and you will have several teeth missing, God be praised, Brief Encounter.
  There you are, on a rain-soaked morning, trudging up or down the hillside to go
  to tend your pigs, or hens, and all of a sudden the Groist invades your brain. You
  are understandably startled, and some think this startlement is what inspired some
  of history''s mystics, lean and fat, that is, a visitation from the Groist.

  It burrows into your brain, nestles there awhile, then flees as suddenly as it came.

  Saint Teresa of Avila may well have had an experience, mutatis mutandis, of the
  Groist.

  Ah, but when I said I would be specific I was very specific. I pointed to only three
  occasions, ghost writer, phantom pregnancy, when the Groist has made itself known.
  Was I right? No. That is another thing about the Groist, and its ability to startle,
  it encourages us to say with certainty what is certainly not certain, is still conjecture,
  Henry, Henry.

  One thing we know that the Groist does, on its visitations, apart from making us
  think we have had mystic visions, is to deter us from glubb glubb glubb. What is
  it, exactly? A worm in the brain. Beloved of distraction, and beloved to distraction,
  too.


  BILINGUAL COMINTERN MOCKER

  Back in the days of Stalin, it was a brave soul who mocked the Comintern. Uncle
  Joe and his myrmidons tended to get attacks of the vapours when ridiculed. Svetlana
  B was not particularly brave, however. For one thing, she mocked the Comintern from
  the comparative safety of a radio shack hidden in a village in the English fens,
  which she pronounced "fence". Her regular nightly broadcasts were inaudible outside
  the shack itself, because none of her equipment was plugged in to any kind of power
  source. Remember that we are talking here of fenland in the 1930s. You would be
  lucky to get hot water out of a spigot, let alone mock the Comintern and be heard
  by dissident ham radio enthusiasts in Vladivostok, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk,
  Perm, or Omsk. Nevertheless, Svetlana B took no chances, and her fierce mockeries
  of the Comintern were delivered in two languages unfamiliar to Stalin''s brutes.
  She talked in Ga, a variant of Nkra, spoken in the coastal towns of Eastern Ghana
  and the subject of a fascinating Grammar by C Protten published in Danish in 1764,
  and then repeated herself in Avestan, the sacred language of Zoroastrianism. Small
  Zoroastrian communities still exist in the Iranian towns of Yazd and Kerman, but
  these were strategically unimportant to the Soviet Empire. Even if her words had
  been transmitted, however, more often than not they would have been drowned out
  by the roaring icy gales sweeping across the flat and forbidding fens. Sometimes
  the radio shack was so cold that Svetlana B took her samovar with her to brew up
  some steaming mugs of tea. No one had ever told her that it was an ornamental samovar.
  Svetlana B''s husband had a Stalinist hat, a Stalinist moustache, and a heavily
  pock-marked face just like Stalin. His appearance was the subject of much taunting
  by school-age fenland rascals, but that is another story, one that will keep, for
  there is much else to tell about Svetlana B, and her bilingual Comintern mockery,
  and her samovar, and the fens, particularly the fens, the cold flat spooky wet black
  fens, and the nocturnal animals which creep there, and the phantoms that shimmer
  in the mist. I will tell you more on another night, children, for now it is time
  for your bedtime snack of fish-heads and hot cocoa.


  TWO DAYS IN THE LIFE OF BLODGETT

  It was a splendid Thursday morning. The squalls and drizzle were over. I sat in
  my space-age brunch module having a key snacking occasion, not unaware that the
  price of Brent crude had shot through the roof. I kept a couple of barrels in the
  cellar, under a tarpaulin, and decided to go and check that they had not been disturbed.
  Gulping down the last of my vitamin-enhanced celery-and-watercress health drink
  with added iron, I was about to unlatch the pod in which I stored all the house-keys
  when something appalling happened.

  Later that day, as I drove at unimaginable speed across the tundra, the sound of
  Thijs Van Leer''s Introspection 1 CD blaring out of the speakers, all thoughts of
  prog rock were forgotten when I had to swerve to avoid an obstacle which appeared
  suddenly in front of me. Such abrupt movements did not suit my turbopropulsion eight-wheeler,
  and I knew immediately that the suspension was wrecked. I brought the vehicle to
  a halt, mopped my brow, and looked back. What was that thing I had so nearly smashed
  into? It was the shape of a breakfast cereal packet, but much, much bigger, and
  it emitted a glow that sixth sense told me was dangerously radioactive. I flipped
  open my microcommunicator, adjusted the nozzles, and shouted into it. "Boloslaw!"
  I yelled, "You''d better get down here at once!"

  Next morning, in the lab, I watched as Boloslaw fiddled about with any number of
  complicated mechanical bittybobs. I was tired. "I''m going to take a nap," I told
  my pneumonia-racked colleague, "Wake me up if anything happens." I trudged wearily
  through the corridors towards the sterile bunkbed sector. How did I get lost? I
  thought I knew this place as well as I knew my reflection in the shaving mirror,
  but I was wrong. Ten minutes after leaving the lab, I was completely incapable of
  recognising my surroundings. Exhaustion made me decisive. I slid open the next door
  I came to, entered the chamber, and found myself face to face with something indescribable.

  That evening we had a dinner party. Snetterton was talking about hedge fund acquisition
  analysis models in his entertaining way, but I had other things on my mind. Earlier,
  I had read an e-codex raising the spectre of hectic global mayhem, and I was determined
  to stop it. Excusing myself from the table by muttering something about a missing
  fork, I headed for the pantry and switched on the secret receiver. Ignoring the
  blue sparks and crackles from this antiquated device, I placed my ear against the
  node. At that very moment, a terrified weasel dashed across the room and sprang
  at me.

  That was Thursday and Friday. I was looking forward to the weekend more than ever.

  HOW TO LOOK AFTER A HORSE

  B--Have you a horse?

  E--I have a horse.

  B--This horse you have, has it been known to suffer from some common ailments of
  the horse?

  E--A horse I have. A knowledge of horse health I have not.

  B--Better put "horse ill-health" than "horse health". Lack of horse ailment knowledge
  would suggest you know not of spavins, sweeney, ringbone, windgalls, poll evil,
  callous, cracked heels, galls of all kinds, fresh wounds, sprains, bruises, fistula,
  sitfast, sand cracks, strains, lameness, foundered feet, scratches or grease, mange,
  rheumatism, bites of animals, external poisons, painful nervous affections, frost
  bites, boils, corns, whitlows, burns and scalds, chilblains, chapped hands, cramps,
  contraction of the muscles, swellings, weakness of the joints, caked breast, &c.

  E--I know them not but find it hard to credit they are all ailments of horse.

  B--They are indeed not entirely those of the horse, but of that no matter. My point
  is that by making purchase of Geo. W. Merchant''s Celebrated Gargling Oil, unparalleled
  in the history of medicine as the most remarkable external application ever discovered
  for horses and human flesh, you will cure your horse of all the specified ailments.

  E--I shall make such purchase without further ado.

  Hooting Yard is indebted to Odd Ends. Go there and be delighted.'
