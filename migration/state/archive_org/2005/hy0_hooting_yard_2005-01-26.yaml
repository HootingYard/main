full_text: 'FIVE TINY BIRDS

  Look, look! Here are five tiny birds!


  That was a tiny bobolink, I am sure of it. I know a bobolink when I see one, which
  is not often, admittedly, as I live in a hermit''s cave, though I am not a hermit
  by inclination. I am garrulous.


  And that looks like a tiny pyrrhula, Stalin''s favourite bird, according to The
  Fat Compendium Of Spurious Bird-Related Facts About The Soviet Union, my father''s
  favourite book. My father was garrulous too, and no one ever asked him to live in
  a cave. He lived above a shop that sold prosthetic limbs. Here comes another tiny
  bird!


  It is a tiny scarlet tanager. Now that is a bird I have never heard of before.


  Gosh! Hot on its heels comes a tiny painted bunting, not that birds have heels as
  such. They have claws and talons or very thin little twig-like feet. Some say that
  long, long ago human beings began to write by copying the tracks made by the feet
  of birds in snow or mud. There is one more tiny bird to come. I think it will be
  a tiny harlequin duck, I can feel it in my water.


  Oops! I was wrong! It is a tiny mute swan. And now I too will become mute, for it
  is breakfast time, time for a bowl of roots and chaff, and I must concentrate on
  the effective working of my digestive juices.


  CRIME OF THE CENTURY

  That beacon of common sense and moderation, the Reverend Ian Paisley, described
  the recent PS22 million bank robbery in Northern Ireland as "the crime of the century".
  Things bode well for the next ninety-five years, then.

  His comment set me thinking about the crime of the century just gone, so I went
  to Google to have a look. There were 65,800 results, but I was able to discount
  the majority of these because they referred to songs by Shania Twain and Supertramp.
  (On second thoughts... maybe those titles were accurately self-referential.) Anyway,
  the usual suspects were predictably present--JFK, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping*,
  Leopold and Loeb, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and more recently the so-called "war
  on terror" and the destruction of the rainforest--but I was more interested in the
  less celebrated misdeeds which had been described as "the crime of the century".
  These included:

  Government advice that people should take mineral and vitamin supplements

  The demolition of a building in Missouri as part of the US Custom House & Post Office
  Project

  An eight-inch crawdad deposited in someone''s grandmother''s rain barrel

  The recent Ukrainian elections. A Yanukovich supporter said of Yuschenko''s "coup":
  "This is the crime of the century--worse than Hitler, worse than Chernobyl. This
  is a battle to Armageddon. It''s a battle between the Antichrist and Christian peoples.
  They are turning people into orange zombies... all of them have abnormal sexual
  energy."

  Theft of an item of sporting memorabilia from Geelong Football Club

  Publication of the Kinsey reports, Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male (1948) and
  Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female (1953). The perpetrator of this crime of the
  century is denounced as the "patriarch of perversion"

  Something I don''t quite understand about cold fusion theories, to wit: "The hot
  fusioneers have made a fundamental error in judgment. Because they are so thoroughly
  skilled in gas plasma physics, where light-element fusion can and does occur, they
  have expected that any fusion in an electrochemical cell, on or near the surface
  of a metal lattice, must be similar to fusion in a gas plasma. The only way these
  scientists could have been more seriously in error would be to condemn the discovery
  of cold fusion, which some did!"

  The proposed sale of the KPFA radio station by its parent company, the Pacifica
  Foundation

  The theft, from a photo shoot in the South of France, of an advance copy of an album
  by a pop group called U2.


  Left : Charles Lindbergh. Right : a middle-aged man known as "The Edge", or possibly
  "The Hedge". Has some connection with U2.

  *NOTE : It should be well-known by now that eerie fascist Charles Lindbergh accidentally
  killed his child during a prank. Go to The Lindbergh Kidnapping Hoax for the full
  details. You may find it helpful to wear dark glasses when visiting the site.


  BLODGETT''S FIENDISH X-RAY PLOT

  Some say Blodgett conceived his fiendish X-ray plot as revenge against a world that
  laughed at him because he was a short man, but they are wrong. Blodgett was not
  of diminutive stature. He was actually somewhere between six and seven feet tall,
  although it is hard to be precise because he was resistant to tape measures. They
  would become knotted or twisted or indeed simply burst into inexplicable flames
  when Blodgett was near. At a snap of his fingers, similar devices, such as rulers
  or yardsticks, would crumble to sawdust, if they were wooden, or just dust, if made
  of some other substance. Remember that Blodgett was a frightening, frightening man.

  He conceived his fiendish X-ray plot on a wild and windy Thursday just a week after
  Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen discovered X-rays accidentally while studying cathode rays
  in a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube. Despite the fact that the tube was encased
  in a black cardboard box, Roentgen noticed that a barium platinocyanide screen,
  placed nearby by chance, emitted fluorescent light whenever the tube was in operation.
  Hearing the news on some sort of criminal grapevine, Blodgett immediately obtained
  a high-voltage gaseous-discharge tube and a barium platinocyanide screen. He sent
  his minions fanning out around town to steal a black cardboard box, and this led
  to his undoing.

  A dishevelled plain clothes police officer, a protege of Chief Inspector Cargpan,
  apprehended one of Blodgett''s forty thieves trundling a stolen black cardboard
  box down a noisome alleyway in the small hours of the morning. The box was not empty.
  It contained a tangle of enraged and venomous vipers*. The game was up.

  Sometimes, when writing about failed criminal enterprises, one is tempted to embroider
  the bare facts in the interests of entertainment. Here, I am content to let the
  facts speak for themselves. They may not speak eloquently, but they speak, and that
  is enough, one hundred and ten years after the foiling of Blodgett''s fiendish X-ray
  plot.

  *NOTE : Tautology. All vipers possess envenomed fangs, apparently.


  A copperhead pit viper. Imagine lots of these in a stolen black cardboard box.


  BILINGUAL COMINTERN MOCKER

  Back in the days of Stalin, it was a brave soul who mocked the Comintern. Uncle
  Joe and his myrmidons tended to get attacks of the vapours when ridiculed. Svetlana
  B was not particularly brave, however. For one thing, she mocked the Comintern from
  the comparative safety of a radio shack hidden in a village in the English fens,
  which she pronounced "fence". Her regular nightly broadcasts were inaudible outside
  the shack itself, because none of her equipment was plugged in to any kind of power
  source. Remember that we are talking here of fenland in the 1930s. You would be
  lucky to get hot water out of a spigot, let alone mock the Comintern and be heard
  by dissident ham radio enthusiasts in Vladivostok, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk,
  Perm, or Omsk. Nevertheless, Svetlana B took no chances, and her fierce mockeries
  of the Comintern were delivered in two languages unfamiliar to Stalin''s brutes.
  She talked in Ga, a variant of Nkra, spoken in the coastal towns of Eastern Ghana
  and the subject of a fascinating Grammar by C Protten published in Danish in 1764,
  and then repeated herself in Avestan, the sacred language of Zoroastrianism. Small
  Zoroastrian communities still exist in the Iranian towns of Yazd and Kerman, but
  these were strategically unimportant to the Soviet Empire. Even if her words had
  been transmitted, however, more often than not they would have been drowned out
  by the roaring icy gales sweeping across the flat and forbidding fens. Sometimes
  the radio shack was so cold that Svetlana B took her samovar with her to brew up
  some steaming mugs of tea. No one had ever told her that it was an ornamental samovar.
  Svetlana B''s husband had a Stalinist hat, a Stalinist moustache, and a heavily
  pock-marked face just like Stalin. His appearance was the subject of much taunting
  by school-age fenland rascals, but that is another story, one that will keep, for
  there is much else to tell about Svetlana B, and her bilingual Comintern mockery,
  and her samovar, and the fens, particularly the fens, the cold flat spooky wet black
  fens, and the nocturnal animals which creep there, and the phantoms that shimmer
  in the mist. I will tell you more on another night, children, for now it is time
  for your bedtime snack of fish-heads and hot cocoa.


  "THE ARABIC WORD ''BIN'', WITHIN, BECOMES, WHEN..."

  "The Arabic word ''bin'', within, becomes, when it means interval, space, ''binnon'';
  this is the German and Dutch ''binnen'' and Saxon ''binnon'', signifying within.
  The Ethiopian word ''aorf'', to fall asleep, is the root of the word ''Morpheus'',
  the god of sleep. The Hebrew word ''chanah'', to dwell, is the parent of the Anglo-Saxon
  ''inne'' and Icelandic ''inni'', a house, and of our word ''inn'', a hotel. The
  Hebrew word ''naval'' or ''nafal'' signifies to fall; from it is derived our word
  fall and fool (one who falls); the Chaldee word is ''nabal'', to make foul, and
  the Arabic word ''nabala'' means to die, that is, to fall. From the last syllable
  of the Chaldee ''nasar'', to saw, we can derive the Latin ''serra'', the High German
  ''sagen'', the Danish ''sauga'', and our word ''to saw''. The Arabic ''nafida'',
  to fade, is the same as the Italian ''fado'', the Latin ''fatuus'' (foolish, tasteless),
  the Dutch ''vadden'', and our ''to fade''. The Ethiopic word ''gaber'', to make,
  to do, and the Arabic word ''jabara'', to make strong, becomes the Welsh word ''goberu'',
  to work, to operate, the Latin ''operor'', and the English ''operate''. The Arabic
  word ''abara'' signifies to prick, to sting; we see this root in the Welsh ''bar'',
  a summit, and ''par'', a spear, and ''per'', a spit; whence our word ''spear''.
  In the Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic ''zug'' means to join, to couple; from this the
  Greeks obtained zugos, the Romans ''jugum'', and we the word ''yoke''; while the
  Germans obtained ''jok'' or ''jog'', the Dutch ''juk'', the Swedes ''ok''. The Sanscrit
  is ''juga''. The Arabic ''sanna'', to be old, reappears in the Latin ''senex'',
  the Welsh ''hen'', and our ''senile''. The Hebrew ''banah'', to build, is the Irish
  ''bun'', foundation, and the Latin ''fundo'', ''fundare'', to found. The Arabic
  ''baraka'', to bend the knee, to fall on the breast, is probably the Saxon ''brecau'',
  the Danish ''brakke'', the Swedish bracka, Welsh ''bregu'', and our word ''to break''.
  The Arabic ''baraka'' also signifies to rain violently; and from this we get the
  Saxon ''roegn'', to rain, Dutch ''regen'', to rain, Cimbric ''roekia'', rain, Welsh
  ''rheg'', rain. The Chaldee word ''braic'', a branch, is the Irish ''braic'' or
  ''raigh'', an arm, the Welsh ''braic'', the Latin ''brachium'', and the English
  ''brace'', something which supports like an arm. The Chaldee ''frak'', to rub, to
  tread out grain, is the same as the Latin ''frico'', ''frio'', and our word ''rake''.
  The Arabic word to rub is ''fraka''. The Chaldee ''rag'', ''ragag'', means to desire,
  to long for; it is the same as the Greek ''oregw'', the Latin ''porrigere'', the
  Saxon ''roeccan'', the Icelandic ''rakna'', the German ''reichen'', and our ''to
  reach'', to rage. The Arabic ''rauka'', to strain or purify, as wine, is precisely
  our English word ''rack'', to rack wine. The Hebrew word ''bara'', to create, is
  our word to bear, as to bear children: a great number of words in all the European
  languages contain this root in its various modifications. The Hebrew word ''kafar'',
  to cover, is our word ''to cover'', and ''coffer'', something which covers, and
  ''covert'', a secret place; from this root also comes the Latin ''cooperio'' and
  the French ''couvrir'', to cover. The Arabic word ''shakala'', to bind under the
  belly, is our word ''to shackle''. From the Arabic ''walada'' and Ethiopian ''walad'',
  to beget, to bring forth, we get the Welsh ''llawd'', a shooting out; and hence
  our word ''lad''. Our word ''matter'', or ''pus'', is from the Arabic ''madda'';
  our word ''mature'' is originally from the Chaldee ''mita''. The Arabic word ''amida''
  signifies to end, and from this comes the noun, a limit, a termination, Latin ''meta'',
  and our words ''meet'' and ''mete''. I might continue this list, but I have given
  enough to show that all the Atlantean races once spoke the same language." -- Ignatius
  Donnelly, Atlantis : The Antedeluvian World


  MRS GUBBINS'' NEW PUBLISHING VENTURE

  That indefatigable crone Mrs Gubbins has announced the launch of a brand new, subscription-only
  magazine. Here she is, to tell us all about it:

  Hello readers. It was a dark and stormy night, just like in that novel by Edward
  Bulwer-Lytton, and I was lying awake in bed, tossing and turning under my counterpane,
  watching little fairies twinkling over by my washstand, when I had one of my bright
  ideas. Actually the fairies may have been moths. Anyway, all of a sudden I realised
  that there would be a huge market for a glossy magazine, with a spine, probably,
  devoted to velcro, dubbin and crayons. I jumped out of bed, a bit creakily, and
  went over to my escritoire, rummaged for my lorgnette, found a pad and pencil, and
  scribbled down my ideas in the dark, because my little lamp is broken and I was
  too excited to go all the way across the room to turn on the main light.

  I decided to call my magazine A Daily Digest About Velcro, Dubbin And Crayons By
  Bathsheba Gubbins (Mrs). That has a nice ring to it, don''t you think? In the first
  issue I thought I would tell my thousands of subscribers the story of how George
  de Mestral invented velcro in 1948 after taking his dog for a walk. "I will design
  a unique, two-sided fastener," he decided, "one side with stiff hooks like burrs
  and the other side with soft loops like the fabric of my pants. I will call my invention
  velcro--a combination of the words velour and crochet. It will rival the zipper
  in its ability to fasten." That would take up a few pages.

  Then I would have a picture spread about dubbin, a combination of oils, beeswax
  and other waxes, hence the pleasant smell when opening the can. I would have to
  make a few telephone calls come morning to see if I could include a little scratch-and-sniff
  panel on page 14.

  The remainder of issue one would be an exciting article all about crayons, including
  the fact that Alice Binney came up with the brand name Crayola by combining two
  words that mean "oily chalk". Craie, in French, means chalk, and oleaginous means
  oily.

  By the time I had planned out the first issue the storminess had ceased and the
  night was still, but before going back to bed to have a good long snooze, I made
  a quick note about what should go on the cover. I decided that each issue should
  have a full-colour cover-picture of a celebrity, if possible shown holding or using
  or maybe just ruminating upon velcro, dubbin, or crayons. Who could it be for the
  launch issue? It would have to be a toss-up between new US Secretary of State Condoleezza
  Rice and Glenn Cornick, one-time bass guitarist of Jethro Tull.

  I scrambled back to bed happy in the knowledge that subscriptions would come pouring
  in.

  CURD

  The above quotation from Sabine Baring-Gould describes an insubstantial, phantom
  figure with a "complexion of curd". That phrase applies perfectly to the indubitably
  solid, corporeal person of Dr P V C Pote, the subject of one of Dobson''s most inspiring
  pamphlets. Indeed, Dobson begins with a highly-wrought flight of fancy in which
  he suggests a number of alternatives for his subject''s ever-enigmatic initials,
  among which is "Pallor Very Curd-like".

  Dr Pote would be forgotten today had he not achieved a kind of immortality via the
  sixty-page biography in which Dobson''s prose achieves an almost hallucinatory opulence.
  Here is the celebrated passage in which Pote''s prowess as a speaker is lauded:

  "This pallid man with a complexion of curd held his listeners spellbound as, standing
  upright in a high wind, he told them of the death of Avicenna, by taking nine clysters
  together in a fit of the Colick. His audience had no sooner digested this news than
  the good doctor moved on, informing them that all the air beyond Thule is thick,
  condensed and jellied, looking just like sea lungs. They badgered him with questions,
  all of which he answered with good grace, and no little humour, before describing
  to them a snow piece, of land and trees covered with snow and ice, and mountains
  of ice floating in the sea, with bears, seals, foxes, and variety of rare fowls
  upon them, then explaining the priests'' curing of mad dogs by burning them in the
  forehead with Saint Bellin''s Key, before describing the quite unrelated matter
  of a noble Quandros or stone taken out of a vulture''s head. Brains bedizened by
  the doctor''s magpie mind, his listeners were near replete, yet he had one more
  topic for them, ending his lecture with a twenty-minute anecdote of bewildering
  complexity about a glass of spirits made of aethereal salt, hermetically sealed
  up, kept continually in quicksilver; of so volatile a nature that it will scarce
  endure the light, and therefore only to be shown in winter, or by the light of a
  carbuncle, or Bononian stone. And then he was done, and he pulled his black cape
  about his shoulders, and swept away, into the wind, implacable and majestic, of
  the finest fibre from which a man can be hewn, notwithstanding a pallor of curd."'
