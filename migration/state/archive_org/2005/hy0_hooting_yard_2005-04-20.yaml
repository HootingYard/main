  The Hooting Yard Educational Outreach Hub announces a brand new correspondence course
  in Bird Recognition Skills, and not before time. As a taster, we are posting Module
  One on the site. Note that participants who successfully complete the entire course
  will be presented with an embossed certificate which gives full accreditation for
  entry to our upcoming courses on Advanced Bird Recognition Skills and Locust And
  Killer Bee Recognition Skills.

  Module One : The Beak

  A surefire method of deciding whether the animal you are looking at is a bird is
  to check whether it has a beak. If it has, then nine times out of ten it will be
  a bird. The beak--otherwise known as the bill--is the only device a bird has for
  consuming food. Birds have no teeth so they must swallow their food whole. A bird''s
  beak can vary in size and shape depending on the nature of their diet. Some birds
  such as falcons have evolved to have a cutting-type beak which allows them to tear
  through flesh with violent and blood-crazed savagery, whereas the hummingbird has
  a probe-like beak which allows it to drink the nectar from certain flowers, such
  as primroses, buttercups and elecampine, although you would be advised to check
  the accuracy of those examples in a botanical dictionary such as An Alphabetical
  Guide To What Every Infant Should Know About The Majesty Of Nature by Dobson.

  The beak is composed of an upper jaw called the maxilla, and a lower jaw called
  a mandible. From this the student can infer that all birds have two jaws. Remember
  that. Bird beaks are useful in other ways, for example woodcutters use theirs to
  cut wood, and parrots have sharp swivelled beaks to tear fruit, although their ripping
  and tearing is not quite as maniacal as those falcons mentioned earlier. Small mammals
  like hamsters and guinea pigs are quite safe from the average parrot, which is more
  likely to become ravenously ferocious in the presence of a grapefruit or a fig.
  Flamingos have long beaks to pull out fish from the water and ducks have flat beaks
  that allow them to retain all the fish and plants while draining out the water.

  Generally speaking, if it hasn''t got a beak, it is unlikely to be a bird. Try not
  to confuse a beak with a beaker, which is a drinks container like a mug or a tumbler,
  often but not always made of plastic, or with the Beaker People, which refers to
  an archaeological culture present in prehistoric Europe, defined by a pottery style--a
  beaker with a distinctive bell-shaped profile--that many archaeologists believe
  spread across the western part of the continent during the third millennium BC.
  If you have been paying attention you should be able to differentiate between those
  long-dead people and present-day birds.

  In closing, remember that although they can fly, locusts do not have beaks, therefore
  they are not birds.

  Sample questions:

  1. Complete the following sentence: That carbon-based living organism over there
  perched on a tree branch has a beak, so it must be a) a weasel, b) a big magnetic
  robot, c) a bird.

  2. Imagine you are living in the third millennium BC and you are holding a bell-shaped
  piece of pottery. Are you a) a member of the Beaker people, or b) a cassowary?

  3. Look at the two pictures below. Which one is a herring gull with a very sharp
  beak designed to attack you?


  Picture A, left, and Picture B, right. One of these is a herring gull.


  HOW TO THINK OF THINGS OTHER THAN JUGGLING

  This is a splendid exercise first developed by brain guru Dennis Beerpint, brother
  of the poet Gervase Beerpint (see 3rd February). Go to a field. Attaching clamps
  to slats with quarter-inch gulliver bolts, smear some lattice-work with a decoction
  of binding-agents and thread the netting through tin clips, then dislodge the hasp
  on the paddle in order to provide enough purchase on the metal flanges, which should
  be arranged in rotation beside colour-coded pails, the white one being strapped
  to a clogged bracket, the red one spinning on the torque engine, the blue one held
  in place by rubber frets, and the black one chiming against the aluminium knob on
  the wicket, which is fastened to the anchorage unit by a system of winches controlled
  by a clay handle on the bole, against which pellets are fired at pre-arranged intervals
  by the steam gun just below the fourth set of nozzles, cleverly positioned at such
  a distance from the first three sets to provide a constant stream of gases to pass
  over the tarpaulin, in which punctures have been made to allow ease of passage for
  the andiron tubes carrying ballbearings to the spandrel and thus on to the rotating
  wooden platform, upon which the greased hinges chafe against the pulleys sufficiently
  for the sparks to ignite sulphur bombs inside the bakelite carriage, without endangering
  the pads, bulbs and chocks on the hooter, at the sounding of which the intricately-wired
  snares snap shut and entrap the oiled plasticine clumps, thus momentarily halting
  the recurrent biting movements of the cogs on the discus, throwing shards of todge
  into the motor around which you will have placed canvas bags packed with candles
  in order to steady the persistent rattling of the ticker on the back of the iron
  sledge underneath the trolley carrying the double battery-powered hammer which serves
  to agitate the drum containing the four-inch blades detached from the rusted bowl
  of the compass, held in place on the rocket by a monstrous titanium screw wedged
  against the plackets of the grit distributor, customised by locking its gut probes
  into position with no less than twenty six separate multiple-gate plugs, on each
  of which a scorched zinc disc swivels in response to the magnetic properties of
  the special basin receiving the droplets of highly acidic gum arabic spilling out
  of the glass globe tethered to the scalding hot clasps of the larger plate by chains
  which run parallel to the lengths of string tied at one end to the pirate''s aureole
  and at the other to the shank of the casket nailed to the box of flags stolen from
  the same warehouse which provided the hooks for the plank balanced uneasily across
  the gap between the pinboard and the hodometer fitted with small beeswax parcels
  lashed to the crane from which dangle several springs and coils loaded with lead
  weights and enamelled cubes the purpose of which becomes apparent when the gleaming
  cork is plunged into the canister of boiling duckpond water kept at constant temperature
  by hastily-repaired piping fed by siphons and buttressed by giant prongs from the
  surfaces of which have been expunged precisely engraved instructions for the use
  of the inspirational choir funnels hidden inside the derrick next to the pumps on
  the tray of bauxite pebbles wrapped in hideous orange taffeta swaddling material
  as a sop to the git who provided the jars, flakes and asbestos-free wing cranks
  you will require for timing the bleaching operation on the plastic squirting mechanism
  moulded out of discarded beetle caps salvaged from a manufacturer of resins whose
  grotesque sponge hood has been incorporated into the workings of the shiny magnesium
  tripod atop which lurks a uranium pill squashed underneath a varnished Icelandic
  pan containing phosphorus hoops and a glamorous leather trumpet pitched towards
  a cobalt beaker lit up by the Mackenzie Beam angled obliquely next to a yellow fustian
  canopy covering a massive trellis to which are glued an up-ended cone of polythene
  veiled by cotton-wool wrapped around a toy horse with a propeller caked in mercury
  powering the fulcrum and bails on the fractured tub countersunk behind the crust
  of a feather on a stool with pins affixed to the leaching grille placed askew atop
  the big cracked bucket of winnowed sand. Now stand back and count to a hundred.
  You will have forgotten all about juggling.


  A PARLOUR GAME

  Thisis a parlour game, popular in Finland, in which the players must imagine themselves
  hopelessly trapped in an abandoned and waterlogged mineshaft, quite alone apart
  from the company of a notorious psychopathic murderer.

  There are two sets of cards which must be shuffled mightily and placed face down
  on the table. From the first pack, players are allowed to choose three cards each,
  on which, when turned over, they will find written the name of an object or implement
  which may be used to effect an escape. A typical selection could read: a pin-cushion
  (innocent of pins); a small AA battery (dead); and twelve postage stamps from the
  Plunkett collection (non-adhesive).

  A further three cards, from the second pack, are then chosen. These will give further
  crucial information about each player''s entrapment, to wit, for example: your left
  leg is broken in three places; you have been blind since birth; and a starling has
  built its nest in your tremendous bouffant.

  Players are each given forty five seconds to describe their method of escape, which
  must be plausible, vivid, logically watertight, and lead to the apprehension of
  the psychopath by doughty Inspector Calloway and his lame bloodhound, Tim.


  POTTED BIOGRAPHIES OF A MARINE HUE, NO. 1

  Captain Flask, of the HMS Corrugated Cardboard, was a bad and dangerous man. He
  never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badgers. His ship was falling
  apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, like
  the rigging, or a fo''c''sle, or even the whole orlop deck, he would fly into a
  rage like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed, and go
  back below decks to their scrimshaw and grog.

  Every day, all day, and every night, all night, Captain Flask lurched around the
  deck, shouting at the sky. In the pocket of his weskit, where his fob watch ought
  to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds
  that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loathed, and cormorants,
  which he did not understand, but his aim was not good, and he usually missed.One
  of his arms was withered from scrofula.

  His fob watch lay, abandoned, in the untidy drawer of his escritoire, hidden among
  old pencils, bits of calico, drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust. Every
  morning at six o'' clock, or whatever that is in maritime parlance, Captain Flask
  drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia.

  Oh, he was such a bad man! Such a dangerous man!


  MISTER SCRIMGEOUR''S AVIARY

  Last Tuesday, Mr Scrimgeour realised his lifelong ambition. Five hundred yards to
  the south of the Pang Hill Orphanage, he threw open the gates of his aviary. The
  tots had been gathered outside for three hours, the tinier ones literally wetting
  themselves with excitement. The big fat sun battered down: it was a cloudless day.

  Mr Scrimgeour had announced the opening of his aviary only the day before, but work
  had been going on for months, if not years. The parentless infants had grown used
  to the sight, from the orphanage windows, of a gigantic fence of corrugated iron.
  Suddenly, overnight, it was gone, the outer walls of the aviary visible at last.
  As they ate their breakfast porridge, they were told that they would be the very
  first visitors. Mr Scrimgeour did not even want to be paid.

  And now, at noon, they marched solemnly in, their excitement replaced by awe. At
  first, there were no birds to be seen. Beyond the main gate, at the end of a muddy
  pathway, were two further gates: huge, of beaten bronze, and each with a sign upon
  it, a single word, black on white, in letters so plain and clear that even the most
  myopic infant could read them, if they could read at all, and many of them could
  not, because the Pang Hill Orphanage was a notoriously ill-run institution, the
  principal an unscrupulous ex-mariner who picked his staff from wretched sinks of
  iniquity down by the docks. Between the gates stood Mr Scrimgeour, wearing a peculiarly
  dainty hat.

  "Hello, hello, oh hello children!" he cried, his jollity somewhat forced. "You must
  come and see my birds! But you must choose. You may only enter through one gate.
  On one side, you will find cages containing specimens of all the birds that the
  Bible says are clean. And on the other, the birds that the Bible says are unclean.
  The choice is yours!"

  The poor little Godless tinies looked at each other, and at Mr Scrimgeour, and at
  the gates. Whatever may lie behind them, the gates themselves were identical--neither
  glistening and shiny nor stained and splattered with muck. They did not know that
  behind one gate they would find turtle doves, pigeons, quails, sparrows, swallows,
  cocks and hens, partridges and cranes, and that behind the other were eagles, ossifrage,
  ospreys, vultures, gledes, kites, ravens, owls, great owls, little owls, hawks,
  nighthawks, cuckoos, cormorants, swans, pelicans, gier eagles, storks, herons, lapwings,
  bats, ostriches, peacocks and bitterns. The poor little mites had no idea at all,
  and they could certainly not ask for guidance from the ruffians in whose charge
  they languished. No doubt, dear reader, you have read your Bible and can run to
  the orphans'' aid, and while you are about it, release the bats!


  BATS

  Having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming experience, and not
  at all like being bled by leeches. In the latter case, you are likely to be attended
  by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply the leeches and make reassuring
  noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through a swamp, and leeches will fasten
  upon your legs and begin to drain your blood, but in such cases you are unlikely
  to notice them, as you will be half-submerged in the swamp, therefore in your ignorance
  of the leeches you will not be frightened. A vampire bat is likely to attack you
  without warning, however, and so you will be alarmed.

  Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle, Egyptian fruit, red, long-nosed,
  little brown, pallid, western mastiff, serotine, pocketed free-tailed, woolly false
  vampire, hoary, Indiana, northern, ghost-faced, greater horseshoe, Brandt, Honduran
  white, Natterer''s, lappet-browed, noctule, Ipanema, tent-making, big brown, evening,
  yellow, spotted, Nathusius pipistrelle and other bats with vampire bats, and thus
  being fearful of them all. But only the vampire bat will plunge its fangs in to
  the soft white flesh of your neck and begin to drain you of your vital gore. If
  you are awake, and especially if you are active, for example playing lawn tennis,
  orienteering, or doing outdoor carpentry, you will be able to fight off the vampire
  bat. Remember that you are bigger and stronger than it is, and be not afraid.

  On the other hand, if you are fast asleep, and unprotected by an anti-bat curtain
  of heavy purple brocade, the vampire bat may suck your blood uninterrupted, until
  its thirst is sated. If you are the bat''s first victim for a while, it may drink
  all of your blood, and you will not wake up, because you will be lifeless. Do not
  believe those foolish stories about waking after a visit from a vampire bat and
  tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and thenceforth being a kind of undead
  human version with a bloodlust of your own. That will only happen if you live in
  Transylvania and bear a resemblance to Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney. Note that Lon
  Chaney is not to be confused with Lyn Cheney, wife of the current US vice-president.

  ON ASTROLOGY


  Eight years and one month ago, I posted the following horoscope here at Hooting
  Yard:

  Our horoscopes are based on the so-called Blodgett Astrological System of six, rather
  than twelve, signs. Over many years, forecasts made under this system have proved
  over eight hundred and forty-eight times more reliable than all that Pisces and
  Aquarius nonsense! You can work out which sign you are by referring to the absolutely
  splendid up to date online guide at www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/humanfate.html
  (site under construction).

  Fruitbat. Try to remember that you are lactose-intolerant. The hours before twilight
  will be significant for your pet stoat. Throw away that tub of swarfega.

  Mayonnaise. It is time to dig out your copy of Gordon "Sting" Sumner''s profound
  I Hope The Russians Love Their Children Too and play it again after all these years.
  You may overhear the phrase "going postal" more than once this afternoon. Pay special
  attention to patches of bracken.

  Coathanger. Your recurrent nightmares about an albino hen will finally make sense.
  Don''t go near any buildings, large or small.

  Slot. At last your destiny will begin to unfold, probably as you take a stroll along
  the towpath of the old canal. Vengeful thoughts will assail your brain, but you
  should ignore them, and devote your energies to making jam. A hollyhock may have
  special meaning for your kith and kin.

  Tarboosh. O what can ail thee, horoscope reader, alone and palely loitering? Make
  sure you treat yourself to an electric bath and a session in a sensory deprivation
  tank. The Bale of Gas in your House of Stupidity has incalculable effects. You will
  stand on the steps of the Insane Asylum, and hundreds of men and women will stand
  below you, with their upturned faces. Among them will be old men crushed by sorrow,
  and old men ruined by vice; aged women with faces that seemed to plead for pity,
  women that make you shrink from their unwomanly gaze; lion-like young men, made
  for heroes but caught in the devil''s trap and changed into beasts; and boys whose
  looks show that sin has already stamped them with its foul insignia, and burned
  into their souls the shame which is to be one of the elements of its eternal punishment.
  A less impressible person than you would feel moved at the sight of that throng
  of bruised and broken creatures. A hymn will be read, and when the preachers strike
  up an old tune, voice after voice will join in the melody until it swells into a
  mighty volume of sacred song. You will notice that the faces of many are wet with
  tears, and there will be an indescribable pathos in their voices. The pitying God,
  amid the rapturous hallelujahs of the heavenly hosts, shall bend to listen to the
  music of these broken harps.

  Nixon. Vile dribbling goblins covered in boils will make life difficult today.

  Why am I returning to this old horoscope today?, you may ask. Well, for eight years
  I have been ignoring a cardboard box full of letters which I received in the days
  after this postage appeared. The box--or rather its contents--gnawed at my conscience.
  Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw. I have had a terrible time. If you have ever felt reproached by
  sight of a cardboard box, you will understand what I have been going through. That
  is why I hid the box in a cubby and buried it beneath a pile of rags and locked
  the cubby and took a bus to the seaside and hurled the key as far as I could into
  the broiling ocean. I thought, by doing so, I could put those letters out of mind.
  How could I be so naive?

  After a near decade of mental turmoil, yesterday I called a locksmith and asked
  him to fashion a fresh key for the cubby. With commendable honesty, given that he
  was turning down my custom, he pointed out that the cubby door was of so flimsy
  a nature that even a puny person could bash it open as easily as smashing an egg.
  Watch, he said. And he gave the door a thump and it fell to bits and there was the
  pile or rags and, beneath, the cardboard box, and, in the box, the letters.

  I plucked from the box the first one that came to hand, and read it. Eight years
  had passed, but I remembered every word.

  Dear Mr Key

  I am writing to complain about the horoscope you posted at Hooting Yard yesterday.
  I was born under the sign of Coathanger, so I was fully expecting my nightmares
  about an albino hen to make some sort of sense. I so arranged things that I spent
  the day in an eerie blasted landscape of marshes and moorland, far, oh so far, from
  any buildings. I awaited revelation, but revelation came there none. I can only
  conclude that your so-called horoscope is a piece of piffle. You have ruined my
  life. I am going to take my case to the Astrological Courts, and you will be prosecuted,
  and all your stars will be blotted out, forever!

  Yours vengefully,

  Tim Thurn

  All the other letters were similar. Complaints, gnashing of teeth, rending of garments,
  rage, threats. Some were written in the blood of ducks, never a good sign--and I
  use the word "sign" significantly. I never responded to a single one of these missives.
  I thought I was in the clear. I did not know how grindingly slowly the Astrological
  Courts worked. But yesterday their judgement arrived, in the form of a peculiar
  light in the sky and a distant booming, as of a foghorn or perhaps a bittern. And
  when night fell, I cast my gaze upwards, as I always do, and the sky was empty of
  stars.

  I still believe I did no wrong. I blame Blodgett. I shall appeal to the Astrological
  Courts, and hope for some shred of mercy in the sublunary world.'
