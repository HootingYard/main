full_text: 'SIEVES AND BASINS

  I have long been promising a definitive series of articles on basins, and am well
  aware that readers are champing at the bit. Is there anything else, other than a
  bit, at which one champs? I wish Dobson had written a pamphlet listing other items
  suitable for champing at, but alas!, he never did, to my knowledge. Even had he
  done so, it would be out of print, and I would have the devil of a job tracking
  it down.

  By the way, word reaches me that a complete listing of every single Dobson pamphlet
  has been posted on the internet, but I have yet to track it down. Google gives about
  two and a half million pages for "Dobson" and nearly twenty thousand for "Dobson+pamphlet",
  and finding time to look at that amount of information dizzies my tiny curdled brain,
  I''m afraid. It would help if we knew Dobson''s first name, of course, but I am
  not sure he had one.

  Aloysius Nestingbird once spent a whole winter trying to find out if Dobson''s parents
  ever called him anything except Dobson. He was working from the questionable premise
  that "everyone has a first name", and as a result his health was ruined. They took
  him to hospital in a wheelbarrow, because he was unable to walk, and the ambulance
  persons were unable to get a stretcher into the hayloft where the scholar was holed
  up. He had taken refuge there, covered in straw, as the neurasthenic fits brought
  on by overwork became more pronounced. Nestingbird''s mental state was always fragile,
  as were his shinbones. As a youth he had been an enthusiastic, if incompetent, player
  of hockey, ice hockey, water polo, and other games involving hefty wooden sticks
  capable, when wielded with sufficient force, of smashing his bones to bits, as they
  did, regularly. "It is a bitter irony," he wrote, "that I acquired a second first
  name, being known as Aloysius Splinterbones, whereas I was unable to ever find just
  the one name for Dobson."

  Of course, Splinterbones was not the only nickname that Nestingbird picked up in
  a career that spanned more decades than I can recall with certainty. Whereas the
  provenance of Splinterbones is easily explained, some of the others are mysterious,
  while yet others are highly mysterious. Why, for example, did a little gang of infant
  banditti who roamed the canal towpaths always refer to Nestingbird as Tab Hunter,
  when he bore no resemblance to that celebrated actor? We do not know.

  I have not forgotten that you are champing at the bit for an essay about basins.
  It would have been written by now had I not received a letter from a reader asking
  a deceptively simple question.

  Dear Mr Key, wrote someone signing himself Chris De Burhg [sic], When you write
  your long-awaited and no doubt superb piece about basins, will you be addressing
  the related issue of sieves? After all, surely a sieve is just a basin with holes
  in it?

  As soon as I read this, I rent my garments and let out a shrill cry, like the Wild
  Boy of Aveyron. My dejection was immense. I picked up a handful of pebbles and hurled
  them through the open window at the crows perched on the fence. Then I picked up
  another handful of pebbles, bigger ones, and threw them at the starlings on the
  lawn. I knew that both the crows and the starlings would take their revenge later,
  by pecking at my upholstery and my towels, but the business with the pebbles relieved
  the pressure on my brain and lifted my spirits, albeit temporarily. I went and washed
  my hair with an exciting new shower product, then sat down and fired off a reply
  to my correspondent.

  Dear Mr De Burhg [sic], I wrote, You may think you have asked a simple question
  by raising the issue of sieves as nothing but basins with holes in them, but the
  simplicity is deceptive. I will now have to rewrite the piece from scratch. So distraught
  was I on reading your letter that I rent my garments, let out a shrill cry, threw
  pebbles at crows and starlings, and washed my hair, which is still dripping wet.
  My brain is now calm enough for me to put pencil to paper. I am going to tear up
  everything I have written about basins and begin again.

  I signed the letter with wild stabbing thrusts of the pencil, burst into tears,
  and became all floppy, like a rag doll, neglected and abandoned by the side of a
  hateful pond.


  FICTIONAL SUBSTANCE OF THE WEEK

  This week, the Hooting Yard Fictional Substance Of The Week is ichor.

  Imagine you are in Ancient Greece, taking a stroll on Mount Parnassus. One of the
  Gods of Greek mythology suddenly appears in front of you. Imagine too that you are
  not of a placid and thoughtful nature (as I am sure you are) but a temperamental
  hothead prone to violence. Surprised by the sudden appearance of a Deity--it does
  not matter which one--your first instinct is to lash out in terror and alarm. You
  sock the God on its jaw, cutting its lip. Now, it is not blood which flows from
  the wound, but ichor, a colourless ethereal fluid which ran through the veins of
  all the Greek Gods. If you are of a vampiric bent, be sure not to suck the ichor
  oozing from the God''s cut lip, for though it confers immortality on the Deities,
  it will be ruinous to you as a mere human, for it will poison you.

  Lord Byron wrote : "He pattered with his keys at a great rate, / And sweated through
  his apostolic skin: / Of course his perspiration was but ichor, / Or some such other
  spiritual liquor." That gives you the correct pronunciation.

  Whether ichor is the root of the word icky, as in "That sponge pudding was so icky
  that I felt a great wave of nausea o''erwhelm me to the point of Lovecraftian horror"
  is a moot point.

  Sometimes ichor is not fictional. In geology, ichor is a technical term denoting
  a fluid or emanation from a magma which is held to cause granitization of rock.
  And in medical parlance, it means the watery ooze from an abrasion, scar, or wound.
  Do not be mistaken, next time such an ooze seeps from one of your wounds, that you
  have somehow been transformed into an immortal superbeing. Rather than saying, as
  the Emperor Vespasian did on his deathbed, "I must be turning into a God", you should
  instead go and see your doctor. All the better if your doctor''s surgery is at the
  lip of a magma-riddled volcano.

  Next week''s Hooting Yard Fictional Substance Of The Week will be phlogiston.


  SAG MIR WO DIE BLUMEN SIND?

  After breakfast, I did a quick set of Blotzmann Exercises (Second Handbook), and
  then I hoisted my rucksack on to my back and strode manfully off to the countryside
  to look at all the Blumen. The lake next to the decoy airfield was full of decoy
  ducks. For the first time I noticed a shabby clapboard hut which, according to a
  sign on its roof, was selling items of stationery at bargain prices. I strode manfully
  across the verdant meadows, stepping on innumerable Blumen as I went, and pushed
  my way into the tenebrous interior of the hut, wherein sat a crone sharpening a
  pencil.

  "Hail, crone!" I cried.

  "Hail, wayfaring rucksack-person!" yelled the crone, deafeningly. I was disconcerted.
  From her withered old body, festooned in noisome rags, piped the voice of a youngster.
  I wondered, with a start, if my manful strides had led me inadvertently into the
  spooky Land of Gaar, reputed to be teeming with imps and sprites, spider gods and
  changelings, and with things that should not be. But I had faced peril before, and
  I had eaten a large breakfast. Quick thinking has always been my trademark, so I
  nipped out of the hut and uprooted a fistful of calla lilies to give to the crone.
  If she was a malevolent being from a parallel universe the Blumen would appease
  her, and if she was but a crone, there would be no harm done.

  "Hail once more, crone!" I declaimed, skipping back into the hut, "Here, have these
  calla lilies to brighten up your hovel!"

  The crone accepted my gift graciously. As she reached, creakily, to take the Blumen,
  a slight disarrangement of her rags revealed the source of her arrestingly youthful
  voice. Wires trailed from her sleeve, and following their path across the floor
  I saw that she was attached to a Standard Curpin Voicebox. Mischievously, I turned
  the dial to the "US Vice Presidents" setting, so when next the crone spoke she would
  sound exactly like Spiro Agnew*.

  I was about to ask the price of pencil sharpeners when a shelduck waddled into the
  hut. At least, I thought it was a shelduck. It may have been a teal. Its arrival
  sent the crone into a frenzy of terror. I had to turn down the volume on the Voicebox,
  so loudly did she scream. The teal or shelduck glared at her with uncanny purple
  eyes, and she carried on screaming.

  There was little I could do. My training never prepared me to deal with terrifying
  ducks. Not that I was scared of the teal or shelduck myself, you understand. I fear
  nothing any more, not even those recurring nightmares I have about buttons, for
  I have been following Blotzmann''s Second Handbook for five years. That is why I
  am able to stride manfully about the countryside trampling on Blumen without a care
  in the world.

  I picked up a pencil sharpener and placed a handful of coins in its place. The crone
  still screamed, the duck still stared. I left the hut, and was blinded by the sun,
  bathing the fields in an unearthly light. As I approached Gruesome Ditch, and my
  eyes adjusted, I saw that all the Blumen had vanished without trace. And no birds
  did sing.


  *NOTE : It has not escaped my attention that Spiro Agnew is an anagram of both Grow
  A Penis and Grow A Spine.


  HOON HING BOOM BANG A BANG

  Tap tap tap. Clunk. Tippety tippety tap tap tap. Clunk. Oh. Hoon Hing Boom Bang
  A Bang. A pudding-basin haircut on the Choctaw man. A goat in distress in a faraway
  place. Pins and needles and rigorous thought. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.

  When you fall from a tree you''ve been climbing, and your headache is thumping thump
  thump, and a pig has a snout and a tail, and there''s leakage and victims and loss,
  how are you going to decide the right time to set fire to everything that has to
  be set fire to? Food and shelter and clothing, thousands of seaside resorts, Celine
  Dion''s autograph, Lake Winnipeg, and that pudding-basin haircut on the Choctaw
  Man, his father''s gaze and his mother''s tongue, his brother''s axe and his sister''s
  stick, his daughter''s bell and his other daughter''s bell as well, both the bells,
  chiming away. Oh. Hoon Hing. Tap tap tap. Hoon Hing. Clunk. Tap tap tap. Clunk.
  Clunk. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.

  I went to Oswestry and I went to Dawlish. I took my library books back. Gigantic
  screeching vultures scraped across the sky, and the sky was blue, and the library
  sat on a hill near a lake, that legendary drained lake, where they found the big
  white bones of something that they did not know had ever lived. They drew around
  the bones with chalk and then they took the bones away. They were big and white
  and boxed in crates and tap tap tap, tippety tap, clunk. Clunk.

  Hey there, lantern-jawed rag-wrapped florist. Have you seen these strands of floss?
  The Choctaw Man had some for supper, and now he''s writhing in that ditch. He used
  to be a narcoleptic, then he joined the river police. Now he''s writhing in a ditch
  because he ate those strands of floss. Hoon Hing. Hoon Hing.

  Dark and cumbersome. Love in a mist. An orphan''s shattered view of a hedge. The
  necessity for each of the crew to bale when asked. Here''s your bucket, here''s
  your pail. With U Thant In Kamchatka, an anthology by Several Hands. All those widows
  lurking in doorways slicing up cabbage and shelling peas. I was in the snow with
  a horse and a pillow, and I lavished attention on things unseen. Tap. Clunk.

  Disco jam bag hellpit frock coat. Breakfast jar pot bandage king. That was me in
  all my glory. Tap. Clunk. Hoon Hing Boom Bang A Bang.


  MUSTARD? CUSTARD!

  Mustard? Custard! is an exciting parlour game for all the family, best played in
  pitch darkness. While the lights are still on, each player is dealt a hand of six
  cards. These are then traded frantically until someone has a hand of a single suit.
  This player is designated the timekeeper, and is also in charge of the light switch.
  Each person then places their cards face down on the table.

  The timekeeper draws the curtains, closes any shutters, and turns off the light.
  Using hoops, counters and coat-hangers, the players dash wildly around the room
  bumping into furniture, walls and each other, all the while screaming at the tops
  of their voices. Points are gained for bloodcurdling shrieks, bestial howling, and
  unbridled panic.

  After precisely three hours have passed, the timekeeper switches the lights back
  on. The players have ten seconds to claw their way to the table and collect their
  cards. A non-participating family member or friend then creeps into the room with
  a trolley on which there are two large bowls, one filled to the brim with mustard
  and the other with custard. Big iron spoons are distributed to each player. Starting
  with the person holding the best hand, and then in descending order, each player
  plunges their spoon into one of the bowls, gulps down the yellow goo, and shouts
  "Mustard!" or "Custard!" accordingly.

  When everyone has had their turn, the whole game is repeated from scratch, with
  the important difference that at the end, those who devoured a spoonful of custard
  must choose the mustard, and vice versa.

  There is no outright winner. As in all sports and pastimes, the important thing
  is taking part.


  ORNAMENTAL POND GUILT

  When Blodgett worked as a brain analyst, in the period immediately after a war,
  he became intrigued by cases of what was dubbed Ornamental Pond Guilt. One Saturday
  afternoon, pursuing his own projects in an otherwise deserted lab, he discovered
  that by exposing samples of dead brain tissue to an all-enveloping gas filtered
  through a Kleigland Sieve, he could never achieve the same results twice. He made
  his way to the canteen, notebook in hand, and scribbled down both the data and his
  conclusions while drinking cup after cup of nettle tea.

  By chance, the canteen employed as mop-person a patient who suffered from Ornamental
  Pond Guilt. Pabstus V. was one of the first recorded cases of the syndrome, and
  though by no means cured, his condition was such that he could perform simple tasks
  such as mopping the floor of a canteen. Blodgett spilled some of his tea on the
  floor, and Pabstus V. mopped it up. It is one of the most poignant moments in medical
  history.

  Blodgett was, of course, familiar with the case of Pabstus V. He knew that, when
  following the instructions to assemble an ornamental pond in the garden of his invalid
  mother, the patient had been stricken with a monumental sense of guilt which left
  him a gibbering wreckage of a man. Over the next eight months, a series of quacks
  prescribed various potions, tablets, infusions, and even injections. (The story
  that leeches were applied to his shoulder blades is apocryphal.) Pabstus V. was
  eventually carted off to the clinic, but there was little hope that he would ever
  recover.

  Well did Blodgett know that it was the incredibly complex battery of techniques
  devised by Doctor Fang that had brought the patient so far that he could mop a canteen
  floor. What Blodgett did not know was that the impossibly handsome and stylishly-dressed
  figure wielding the mop to mop up his spilled nettle tea was Pabstus V.

  Doctor Fang, of course, was ridiculously secretive about his methods. When he died
  after toppling into a crevasse during an ill-advised hiking holiday, he left no
  records, not a shred of documentation to allow others to continue his work. There
  was a fear throughout the clinic that Pabstus V. and the thirty-four other Ornamental
  Pond Guilt patients would relapse, and no longer be capable of mopping up canteen
  floors. Hence Blodgett''s Saturday sessions in the lab. He knew that if he could
  discover some way to reproduce Doctor Fang''s results, his name would resound throughout
  the world of brain analysis. A small world to be sure, but it was the universe to
  Blodgett.

  When he came face to face with Pabstus V., but knew him not, that was the first
  nail in the coffin of Blodgett''s career. The second was when Pabstus V., impossibly
  handsome and impossibly clumsy, accidentally whacked the brain analyst on the head
  with the wooden handle of his mop. Blodgett was knocked unconscious. When he came
  to, hours later, he remembered nothing of the last twenty years of his life. He
  was like Ronald Colman in Random Harvest. He thought he was still what he once had
  been, a would-be poet, starving in a garret, and thence he returned, to scribble
  twaddle instead of scientific data. And Pabstus V. remained mopping the canteen
  floor, a little recovered, yes, but still engulfed by Ornamental Pond Guilt until
  his dying day.


  HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT

  He''s back! He''s making grunty noises! It''s the Grunty Man! Just when you thought
  it was safe to let go of your hat, June sees the return of the very very frightening
  Grunty Man, who stalks your nightmares, makes his grunty noises, and then stalks
  some more. Well may you shudder, milksop! Shudder as much as you like, but make
  sure you hold on to your hat. It has been known for centuries that holding on to
  your hat is an effective way of stopping it flying off your head as you quake in
  fear, something we have seen happen so often in times of terror. And no time is
  more terrible than the time when the Grunty Man comes a-stalking, making his grunty
  noises. But wait! If you are in the habit of dyeing your hat, make sure the dye
  is dry before you hold it, or you will get dye on your hand, and being so marked,
  the Grunty Man will sniff you out as he comes stalking and grunting and you will
  be fodder for his maw.

  The Passion Of The Grunty Man opens at the Excelsior Cinema, O''Houlihan''s Wharf,
  very very soon.'
