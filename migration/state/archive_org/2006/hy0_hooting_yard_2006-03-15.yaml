  Task: describe a typical Dobson breakfast scene.

  On the face of it, this sounds like a simple enough assignment. It is, of course,
  anything but. Those who have even a passing acquaintance with the titanic out-of-print
  pamphleteer Dobson know that the words typical and breakfast can never be crammed
  together. It is an understatement to say that he had mixed feelings about breakfast.
  There were times when he was up and about before dawn, gobbling down a huge bowl
  of porridge. Thereagain, he sometimes stumbled downstairs at noon, bleary and fractious,
  waving his arms in dismissal of a proffered slice of toast. From one day to the
  next, there was no knowing how Dobson would greet the day, and howsoever he did
  greet it, no knowing with what foodstuffs, if any, the day would commence.

  I cannot in all honesty, then, describe a typical Dobson breakfast scene, as is
  required of me. Instead, I propose to examine two Dobsonian breakfasts, from different
  stages in his life, to which I will add some observations on a pamphlet he planned,
  but never wrote, on this important topic. Will that do?

  The first breakfast scene I wish to evoke is one that took place when Dobson was
  living around the corner from the notorious flapper Popsie Shadrach. Popsie''s well-kept
  secret at the height of her flapperdom was that she was the devoted mother of an
  infant. Her daughter grew up to become the daredevil adventuress Tiny Enid. At the
  time of this breakfast, however, Tiny Enid was not even a twinkle in her mother''s
  eye. Popsie was returning from a gin joint at dawn, and crashed her jalopy into
  Dobson''s hedge, waking the pamphleteer, who leapt out of bed, thundered out into
  his front garden, carried the stunned demimondaine into his parlour, and sought
  to revive her by winding up his gramophone and playing the Adagio from Bohuslav
  Martinu''s Concerto for string quartet and orchestra at ear-splitting volume. With
  Popsie sprawled on the couch and the music moving inexorably towards its sonorous
  B minor climax, Dobson busied himself in the kitchen. Outside it began to pour with
  rain, and steam hissed from the jalopy''s smashed-up engine, so much steam that
  the hedge was obscured. This was the inspiration for Dobson''s tremendous pamphlet
  Hedges Hidden From Sight By Steam (out of print), the only one of his works to be
  illustrated with watercolours. When the music stopped, Dobson bid the groggy but
  only slightly injured flapper to join him at the breakfast table. He preened, and
  ate bloaters. Popsie contented herself with a tumbler of gin, sucked from a straw,
  for her wrist was sprained and she could not hold the glass.

  We move forward four decades to consider a second Dobson breakfast scene. Bloaters
  have their place here, too, but there is no gin, no Popsie Shadrach, no Tiny Enid
  (by now an adult famed wherever people speak of daredevil adventuresses) and no
  hedge hidden by steam. In fact there is no hedge at all, for Dobson has moved on,
  as we all must, sooner or later.

  The second breakfast I invite you to ponder was prepared and consumed in an anteroom
  on the sixth floor of a palace belonging to the Plenipotentiary Oberstraung General
  of a disputed territory south of the Great Frightening River. What in heaven''s
  name was the impecunious pamphleteer doing in such sumptuous surroundings? I should
  point out that he was only there for three days, having been invited under the mistaken
  assumption that he was a tuner of pianos, an easy error to make, given that his
  most recent pamphlet was entitled I, Piano Tuner! Dobson''s host had clearly not
  read beyond the cover page, for even a cursory reading of the text would show that
  the pamphleteer was wholly ignorant of his subject. It is one of his most mystifying
  tracts, being largely concerned with the unrelated topics of soup and buttons. But
  let that pass.

  There is Dobson, muffled from the workaday world in a suite of rooms hung with rich
  brocade tapestries while embarrassed arrangements are made for a special sealed
  train to whisk him away, leaving the Plenipotentiary Oberstraung General''s piano
  untuned. Morning sweeps across the sky on the pamphleteer''s final morning. The
  train is due at ten. A factotum enters Dobson''s temporary boudoir, bearing a tray,
  and upon the tray is the territory''s traditional breakfast, a dish of boiled marrow
  steeped in honey from rare bees, a block of dry cocoa bread, and a piping hot beaker
  of a local decoction into which a raw egg has been broken. The factotum places the
  tray on a side dresser and flings open the heavy curtains, flooding the room with
  milky light. Turning, the lackey is about to awaken the snoozing pamphleteer, but
  Dobson is nowhere to be seen. The bedclothes are rumpled, discarded pyjamas are
  strewn on the floor, but the breakfastee has vanished. Eventually, the factotum
  tracks Dobson down to an anteroom adjoining the palace''s sixth floor kitchens,
  where he is sitting alone, having helped himself to his breakfast from astonishingly
  well-stocked larders. Dobson is preening, and eating bloaters.

  I said I would end this piece by mentioning an unwritten Dobson pamphlet. He planned
  at one stage to compile a list of every breakfast he had ever eaten, from infancy
  onwards, and made some preparatory notes. To the bald listing, he intended to add
  observations on place-settings, tablecloths, cutlery and crockery, and general ambience.
  We should be thankful that he never actually wrote this work, for it would have
  been as dull as ditchwater, but not the fearsome ditchwater that was the main ingredient
  of the palace breakfast decoction. That ditchwater was by no means dull, for when
  the factotum poured Dobson''s untouched beakerful down the sink, it sizzled and
  hissed and corroded the piping, it corroded the piping of the palace, and the palace
  collapsed.


  EPOCH OF SNARES

  We all know that there was an age known as the Epoch of Snares, but it is surprising
  how little is generally known about it. This was a time when giant badger-like beings
  roamed the hills of the earth, when the oceans were deeper, darker, and more terrifying
  than they are now, and when only the very bravest of souls volunteered to crew the
  enormous primitive container ships that plied across those seas.

  It was an age of seething murderousness, of great cosmic shifts, of roaring winds
  that uprooted the few pitiful scrags of vegetation that struggled for life in soil
  that was not soil as we know it today. In the Epoch of Snares, soil was much more
  friable, and crumbly, and sometimes even very crumbly. It seldom had the compactness
  or density to hold a plant secure from the biting winds, the same winds whose intense
  coldness seemed somehow to inspire the giant badger-like beings up in the hills.
  There were more hills then, higher, more rounded, covering vast expanses.

  In those times shoes had not been invented. Hard to imagine that the fierce and
  burly sailors on those container ships did everything they had to do in bare feet,
  or sometimes wearing sock-like wrappings. We no longer know how such things were
  made, from what materials, with what technology, for all the wrappings that were
  ever worn have perished, and our only evidence is some briskly-scribbled drawings
  done with the aid of a clairvoyant whose brews, when taken in sufficient quantities,
  enabled her to picture the past. Or so she claimed.

  Men and women were outnumbered by pelicans in those days. Some estimates say there
  were two hundred pelicans to every person, but these were not our modern pelicans.
  They came in all sizes, some as tiny as hamsters, others bigger than the biggest
  of the giant badger-like beings that roamed the windswept hills. Some would have
  it that a huge asteroid from a faraway galaxy, lumbered with millions upon millions
  of eggs, smashed into the earth, and the impact scattered these alien eggs and from
  them the pelicans hatched, but this is a frankly ludicrous theory, and one not given
  credence when one considers that it was propounded by a gibbering maniac chained
  to the wall of a cellar in a bleak and derelict village. That maniac is my brother,
  so I know whereof I speak.

  Indeed, so assiduous have my studies been these last fifty years that I believe
  I know more about the Epoch of Snares than anyone else alive. I know what freight
  was carried in those primitive container ships that crossed ceaselessly from shore
  to shore. Bales. A staggering number of bales of every size and description, handled
  and watched over with infinite care by those fearsome, fearless sailors, a special
  breed, so different from the weedy landlubbers who vied for scarce resources with
  innumerable pelicans, and so nearly lost the struggle. But of course the pelicans
  were all but wiped out in just one winter, and even I do not know how that happened.

  The Epoch of Snares is notable, too, because it was an era when only one type of
  cloud appeared in the sky, namely the anvil cloud. The anvil cloud is the description
  for the upper portion of a towering cumulonimbus, mostly ice, which forms high in
  thunderstorms, and there were constant thunderstorms at that time. People did not
  then fear thunder and lightning, as many do today, nor did the pelicans fear the
  wrack and roar of storms, but what do you think it was that had all those giant
  badger-like beings charging back and forth over the hills? Terror, is the answer,
  terror of thunder in particular. These strange beasts'' ears were hypersensitive,
  could hear things that people and pelicans could not, and whatever it was they heard
  in the thunder filled them with fear, and so they would be forever seeking a place
  of safety, but never finding one, for they never came down from the high hills.

  The badger-beings, too, died out, but not at the same time as the pelicans. Geological
  upheavals have flattened many of the hills where they crashed around in panic, and
  no one has yet found any trace of their bones. Perhaps it is true what my brother
  says, that the badger-beings never existed, were but a vapour in the brain of some
  historical fantasist, but I doubt he can be right about that and so hopelessly,
  ridiculously wrong about the pelicans. I hope you will concur.

  As we have seen, the people of that time had no shoes. Nor did they have saints.
  As far as I have been able to ascertain they did not have what we would today think
  of as a religion. To be sure, they subscribed to a cosmogony, they had some dim,
  dull-witted inkling of how the earth and the heavens, the sun and moon and stars,
  and anvil clouds, all fitted together, but it was not one I have wasted time trying
  to understand, for it was clearly idiotic. I have in my pouch a diagram made by
  that clairvoyant I mentioned earlier, which purports to show the universe as understood
  in the Epoch of Snares, but it is a slapdash diagram and, I feel, only muddies waters
  already murky enough.

  And why, everyone asks, sooner or later, is this long-ago age known as the Epoch
  of Snares? Why not the Epoch of Bales, of Badger-beings, of Interplanetary Pelicans?
  Why not the Epoch of Enormous Primitive Container Ships That Plied Across The Seas?
  Why not, indeed, the Epoch of No Shoes? Go to the bleak and derelict village, enter
  that dark dank cellar, approach the gibbering maniac chained to the wall. Ask my
  brother. He will tell you.


  O CURE ME

  The Guardianruns a daily selection from its archives. Today''s article (advertisement?),
  originally published on 6 March 1844, is so good that I am including it here:

  Worms Destroyed : Medicine never witnessed a more important discovery than in Pritchett''s
  Vegetable Vermifuge, a remedy that neither purges, vomits, nor otherwise affects
  the constitution; requires no confinement, has neither taste nor smell, and is so
  harmless that it may be taken by an infant of an hour old; yet never, in one instance,
  failed destroying every worm in the body. It contains not a particle of calomel,
  scammony, gamboge, or other drastic article. Large packets 2s.9d.

  Apoplexy Prevented : Determination of blood to the head effectually prevented by
  the occasional use of Frampton''s Pill of Health, which, by strengthening the action
  of the stomach, prevents alarming giddiness, oppression of the brain, singing noise

  for filling decayed teeth, however large the cavity. It is superior to anything
  ever before used, as it is placed in the tooth in a soft state, without any pressure
  or pain, and in a short time becomes as hard as the enamel, and will remain firm
  in the tooth for many years, rendering extraction unnecessary. It arrests all further
  progress of decay, and renders them again useful in mastication. All persons can
  use Mr Thomas''s Succedaneum themselves with else, without the aid of a dentist.
  Prepared only by Mr. Thomas, surgeon-dentist, 8, Berners-street, Oxford-street,
  London ; price 4s. 6d. Mr Thomas will send it free by post.

  in fits, headache, weakness, heaviness, dimness of sight, confused thoughts, wandering
  of the mind, and all kinds of hysteric complaints. Price 11s.


  SPECKS IN THE SKY

  While I struggle manfully with a patch of desolate-wasteland-between-the-ears syndrome,
  here is another blast from the past, from this day exactly seven years ago. I have
  made a few little amendments, as is my whim:

  A letter arrives from our Antipodean researcher Glyn Webster.

  Dear Uncle Dan : Recently my dreams have been full of boredom and drudgery. The
  work is hard, the company is dull and I''m thoroughly relieved to open my eyes in
  the morning. Sometimes I wake up to find myself hauling my body out of the bed the
  way a shipwrecked sailor might haul himself ashore. What is happening to me? Yours
  in all simplicity, Glyn.

  Devoted Hooting Yard readers may remember Uncle Dan, who used to pen a column here
  entitled Ask Uncle Dan. He was always generous with his advice on matters such as
  leeks, vim, and an old bag full of crocuses, and you can revisit his wise words
  by checking under ''A'' in the 2003-2006 Archival Index.

  [We''ve done it for you! ----Hooting Yard Archivists]

  Alas, this doyen of agony uncles is no longer with us. I always wondered what had
  happened to him, and coincidentally, on the very day Mr Webster''s letter arrived,
  the post person''s sack also contained this missive:

  Dear Mr Key : You don''t know me, and I prefer to remain anonymous. I can tell you
  that I have a waxed moustache, but I hope you will not take the same view as Robert
  Baden-Powell, who wrote ''I was once accused of mistrusting men with waxed moustaches.
  Well, so, to a certain extent, I do. It often means vanity and sometimes drink.''

  I am not vain. I drink only lukewarm tap water, dandelion and burdock, and occasionally
  Tizer. I try not to preen my moustache overmuch, but I confess that waxing it has
  always been a small pleasure of mine, and Lord knows I deserve a small measure of
  pleasure, as who does not?

  But to business! I am writing to you to pass on greetings from a fellow I met up
  in the hills last Thursday. Like me, he was unwilling to divulge his name, but he
  said that you would know who he was. He was dressed in billowing cloth which looked
  as if once it had been a parachute or part of a parachute, and his face had the
  pallor of bean curd. He too, sported a waxed moustache, but I did not smell drink
  on his breath, nor did he seem to be puffed up with vanity. It makes one wonder
  if Baden-Powell had any kind of grip on reality, quite frankly.

  Anyway, as I say, we were up in the hills, this fellow and I. He was standing upright
  on a boulder, peering intently at a speck in the sky in the far distance. ''What
  do you see?'' I asked, when I was close enough for him to hear me above the wild
  and wailing wind. For answer, he merely pointed, and I turned to look at the unmoving
  speck. Neither of us had binoculars, more''s the pity.

  ''I hear the sound of mandolins,'' he said suddenly, in a voice which, curiously,
  reminded me of television presenter Dale Winton, ''For wild is the wind. As for
  what I see, look!, that speck is what I see. I have been watching it for three hours
  and it has not moved. It is a very mysterious speck.''

  I offered him a plum from my fruit-bag, but he refused it because, he said, it was
  bruised, and he would not eat bruised plums. Instead, he took a Surgeon''s Biscuit
  from some pocket or pouch concealed within his billowing cloth, and began chewing
  on it. The wind was howling with even more violence now, and I bid the man come
  shelter with me in an ornithologist''s hide I knew of not a hundred paces away.
  He jumped down from his perch on the boulder with surprising sprightliness, and
  then took me by the arm. It was an overfamiliar yet somehow reassuring gesture.

  And so we sat in the hide, me with my plums and he with his biscuits, and we waited
  for the wind in the hills to die down. To pass the time, we played a game of Tea
  Strainers, improvising with broken twigs.

  When we parted, an hour or so later, he returned to his boulder and pointed out
  that the unmoving speck was still there. I looked, but now I could not see it. I
  preened my moustache and said farewell, but not before promising to write to you.
  Yours faithfully, Mister X.

  There is no doubt in my mind that the man my anonymous correspondent met in the
  hills was Uncle Dan. He was always seeing still specks in the sky that were invisible
  to almost everyone else, and was forever lamenting that, in all his years as an
  agony uncle, no one wrote to him reporting a similar experience. I once asked him
  how he would reply, if someone did, and he muttered something in his Dale Winton
  voice about paralysed chaffinches caught and cushioned in air pockets.

  As for Glyn Webster''s heartfelt plea, I have placed it in a cardboard box along
  with many other unanswered letters to Uncle Dan. One day he may return to us, in
  his billowing cloth, with his waxed moustache and his pallor of bean curd, and his
  mighty, towering wisdom.'
