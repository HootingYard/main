full_text: 'SQUIRRELS : EMISSARIES FROM THE BEYOND?

  In the latest issue of the superb Chat! magazine, Ruth The Truth (the "psychic agony
  aunt") has this advice for Janice from Pembroke: "the squirrel in your garden has
  a message"*. Skeptics, nay-sayers and other blighters will retort that the squirrel''s
  message is likely to be "Give me some nuts" or "Give me some more nuts", but Ruth
  The Truth--and the squirrel-fanciers among us at Hooting Yard--know better.

  I can speak only from my own experience, but it has long been apparent to me that
  squirrels are in fact emissaries from The Beyond. All that hectic twitching and
  scampering is evidence not merely of a high metabolic rate but of the fact that
  their tiny squirrel brains are jam-packed with pulsating psychic energy. I do not
  deny that they want nuts, either to nibble right away or to put in storage for a
  long hard winter, but that is not the whole story. Consider those bushy tails. Have
  you ever wondered why they stick upwards, rather than thumping along the ground,
  like the tails of so many other animals? It is because each hair of a squirrel''s
  tail ends in a minuscule receptor, designed by nature to pick up and capture some
  of the billions of psychic messages swirling around the ether. These spooky thought-phenomena
  are invisible, fugitive and volatile, unnoticed by us humans with our puny minds,
  but they are the very atmosphere of the squirrels'' world. Those quivering psychic
  nodes in their tails strain to pick up signals from those who have passed over to
  the Other Side, be they other squirrels, stoats, weasels, birds, insects, or indeed
  humans.

  Ruth The Truth, in Chat!, does not divulge what message the squirrel in her garden
  has for Janice from Pembroke, and it would be no doubt foolish to try to guess.
  But I am foolish sometimes. Perhaps Janice is a widow, and her departed husband
  has sent reassuring news from Heaven, or, more worryingly, a stricken plea from
  the Pit of Doom and Desolation. Maybe Janice had a pet swan which succumbed to bird
  flu** and it has sent, via the squirrel in the garden, news from that place to which
  perished swans are consigned when they leave the mortal world. It could even be
  that Janice from Pembroke trod accidentally upon a dozing bee on her garden path
  last summer, and the bee is telling her she is forgiven.

  It is unlikely that Janice from Pembroke is a keen reader of both Chat! and Hooting
  Yard, but if she is, I would like to invite her to share with us the message she
  has received from the squirrel in her garden. It may be, indeed, that she is unable
  to translate the message from the argot of squirrels in which it is couched, and
  here we can help, for Mrs Gubbins is a skilled interpreter of these things.

  *NOTE : I am indebted to Charlie Brooker of The Guardian for alerting me to this
  important matter, in a piece entitled Supposing ... The mainstream''s as mad as
  it seems to be.

  **NOTE : Janice from Pembroke could have avoided her swan''s bird flu death had
  she paid careful attention to Saving Your Swan (see 20th February 2006).


  ON THE CROOKED TIMBER OF HUMANITY

  His frostbitten limbs. Sappho in the doldrums. Bad gas and forts. If these phrases
  do not stir you, you are clearly not a devotee of Urbane Geistige Geist, who was
  born one hundred years ago today. If, on the other hand, your brain lit up like
  a beacon on reading those words, you will be one of that little band who rightly
  acknowledge Geist as a key figure in twentieth century popular music.

  ''Popular'' is perhaps not the most appropriate word. Although he worked within
  such fields as jazz, folk, rock, hootcha, pop, and swing, Geist''s music never won
  mass acceptance. He was only ever a cult figure, but it is to be hoped that, with
  the celebration of his centenary, the ears of the world can be opened to his extraordinary
  accomplishment. Who would have thought that an obscure cadet in the Bolivian army
  would become--in the words of one perceptive commentator--a cross between Yoko Ono,
  Xavier Cugat, and Mark E Smith?

  We need not dwell here on Geist''s military career, except to note that he learned
  to play his first instrument--the glockenspiel--when he came under the wing of the
  legendary Bolivian army glockenspiel instructor, Captain Enrique Finisterre Belbacqau,
  a man of whom it has been said that if he did not exist, the staff of the Bolivian
  Army Glockenspiel Training School would have had to invent him. (One body of opinion
  attests that that is precisely what they did, creating a fictional character not
  unlike the supposed agent George Kaplan in Hitchcock''s North By Northwest, for
  whom the Cary Grant character Roger Thornhill is mistaken. This theory has never
  satisfactorily answered the obvious question: if Belbacqua did not exist, who exactly
  did teach Geist his formidable glockenspiel technique?)

  After being thrown out of the Bolivian army because of his flawed cadetship and
  shape-shifting, Geist hitch-hiked to Paraguay, where he soon fell in with a criminal
  gang who, when they weren''t cutting throats and pushing widows into the paths of
  oncoming trains, toted their piccolos and banjos around the market squares of provincial
  towns, playing an infectious combination of bluegrass and light opera. This raggle-taggle
  peasant band became, improbably enough, the first incarnation of The Crooked Timber
  Of Humanity.

  There has been much speculation regarding Geist''s lifelong insistence that the
  groups he led, no matter how often he changed personnel, must always go by the same
  appellation, sometimes as just The Crooked Timber Of Humanity, and sometimes as
  Bolivian Army Cadet Urbane Geistige Geist And The Crooked Timber Of Humanity. He
  took the name from Immanuel Kant''s observation that "out of the crooked timber
  of humanity, no straight thing was ever made", and it is tempting to see this as
  a less than subtle comment on that very first line-up of evil-hearted robbers and
  violent thugs. (Incidentally, Dobson wrote an out of print pamphlet entitled Nomenclature
  of Paraguayan Bandit Musicians & Soviet Collective Farm Administrators Compared,
  in which he proposed that Geist arrived at the name during a tarot reading. This
  is piffle.)

  Sadly, no recording exists of that very first group. By the time the LP Pelf And
  Cant was released, with its magnificent trumpet-driven melodies, all but one of
  the original band were either dead, imprisoned, or hiding in the hills. Geist was
  supremely unconcerned at the almost total loss of his group, demonstrating for the
  first time the ruthlessness which was to make him so feared. As Dave Pod puts it
  in his Oral History Of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity, "You could always tell when
  someone had done their time with Geist''s band. Their hair was prematurely white,
  most of their teeth had fallen out, and they walked, if they were able to walk at
  all, on spavined legs. They trembled uncontrollably, burst into tears every five
  minutes, and were unable to achieve closure on their issues despite extensive, and
  expensive, therapy". Pod''s own band became a sort of rest home for ejected Crooked
  Timber, though artistically he is not fit to lick Geist''s boots. Nonetheless, one
  should not overlook the fact that by throwing in their lot with Pod, the wrecked
  survivors of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity were given a chance to play at the Eurovision
  Song Contest, something that was unlikely to happen under Geist''s iron rule. (He
  did, notoriously, attempt to enter the competition when he kidnapped Kathy Kirby,
  but an international police operation foiled his reprehensible, if entertaining,
  scheme. Many of us would have given our eye teeth to witness that superb twenty-six
  strong line-up of the band, all accordions, trombones and pounding drums, backing
  the British songstress in the specially-written song Black Rubber Beelzebub.)

  His Frostbitten Limbs. Sappho In The Doldrums. Bad Gas And Forts. This was the trio
  of LPs that, for many of us, cemented Geist''s reputation. Released within the space
  of a single month, containing between them no fewer than one hundred songs, shanties
  and pop-madrigals, they still stand as one of the commanding achievements of twentieth
  century music in any genre, vibrant, vivacious, vivid and even, at times, deceptively
  cloth-eared. The story of those fractious recording sessions has been told many
  times, notably in the memoir by lutenist Julian Beam, one of the few band members
  who managed to remain in favour with Geist and appear on all three LPs, although
  his contribution to Bad Gas And Forts consists of a single string-pluck in the middle
  eight of The Gregory Peck Protein Imbalance Song. By the time The Crooked Timber
  Of Humanity appeared on the television show Pop Fabulousness! to promote its release
  as a single, Beam had been "consigned to the outer darkness" as Geist always put
  it, and was hawking his lute-playing skills at a variety of seaside resorts in exchange
  for the price of a cake or bun for his dinner. By the time he came to write his
  book, his arm was withered, his prematurely white hair was infested with beetles,
  and he had all the telltale signs of an ex-Geistist.

  When we recorded the songs on side one of His Frostbitten Limbs, wrote Beam, Geist
  had devised some new ideas. He made us sleep in tents on the sloping roof of the
  studio, wear bells on lanyards around our necks, and force fed us a grey, tasteless
  paste of his own recipe. Every member of the band ballooned in weight and the constant
  clanging of those bells sorely tried the engineer, who had to erase their clamour
  from the tapes. The tents could not be properly secured to the concrete roof, and
  there were violent gales throughout the month, so we got little sleep. Only the
  hammer and tongs players, all six of them, were exempt from this regime. They were
  put up in a luxury hotel and taken to exciting sporting events during breaks. Geist
  himself spent most of the sessions smoking his pipe and making lascivious phone
  calls to a floozie.

  Elsewhere, Beam declared that no recording session had given him such great joy,
  and he continued to idolise Geist for the remainder of his life, until the day his
  pitiful wasted body collapsed in a heap in a post office near the Blister Lane Bypass,
  and he was pronounced dead. Reportedly, his dying words were "Urbane Geistige Geist
  is a profound and matchless genius and everyone should devote their lives to his
  work, as I have been honoured to do, despite the feeble and broken carcass you see
  expiring before your eyes on this post office floor near the Blister Lane Bypa...."

  Geist himself was to die within a week. He had recorded over one hundred and twenty
  LPs, played concerts in almost every country on earth, won the esteem of a dedicated
  troop of followers, and been appointed as a Chevalier De Leo Sayer In Perpetuity.
  Countless times it had been foretold that he would meet his end at the hands of
  a vengeful, dismissed member of The Crooked Timber Of Humanity. Fingers were pointed,
  even while the bandleader was still alive, at bassoonist Ned Nightshade, the man
  who had played such a wonderful solo on a reworking of The Snapping Turtles Of Old
  Cadiz, yet whose heart had shrivelled and rotted when Geist sent him packing. Suspicions
  were raised, too, about Hetty and Ingmar, the Norwegian teenagers who sang on over
  a dozen LPs but were sacked from the band when Geist got himself into a flap about
  something or other.

  In the event, the maestro was not murdered. One damp Sunday he was wheeling a barrow
  of nettles over bracken, whistling the showstopper from his stage musical version
  of Foxe''s Book of Martyrs, when a bee landed on his hat. Geist had always worn
  bee-proof hats until this fateful day, when a mix-up at the dry-cleaners'' found
  him for once in his life unprotected from bees. In a panic, he stopped whistling
  and flew into convulsions. His head flushed purple, he gasped for breath, and his
  tongue became puffy. He did not remove his hat, the fool. He became snagged in the
  bracken, miles from civilisation, and by the time the bee flew back to its hive,
  Geist had become hopelessly entangled. Unable to free himself, he lay on his back,
  staring at the sky, and sang Roll Along Covered Wagon, over and over again, until
  his last breath.

  Roll along covered wagon, roll along, to the turn of your wheels I sing a song,
  city ladies may be fine, but give me that girl of mine, roll along covered wagon,
  roll along. Going home covered wagon going home, for this cowboy was never born
  to roam, ''long the road that doesn''t change, to that old bar twenty range, roll
  along covered wagon, roll along. Yipee-teeyi, old timers, heading for your ranch
  house door, yipee-teeyi, old timers, corral me so I''ll never stray no more. Roll
  along covered wagon, roll along. Come along old pal, let''s get going. Roll along.

  POTTED AUTOBIOGRAPHY

  Occasionally the Hooting Yard postbox is choked with letters from readers all of
  which say, in so many words, "Frank, tell us what you''re really like". My natural
  diffidence makes me reluctant to respond to such pleas, but today I have changed
  my mind. Here, then, is a brief but devastatingly accurate pen-portrait of "Mister
  Hooting Yard".

  Unlike Maya Angelou, I have no idea why the caged bird sings. Nor am I particularly
  given to singin'' and swingin'' and gettin'' merry like Christmas. On the contrary,
  I have an almost fathomless ignorance of ornithological matters and the Yuletide
  season will find me moping and lugubrious. Thus, if I am ever to write a series
  of memoirs, it will not do for me to plagiarise Maya Angelou''s catchy titles. I
  will have to come up with my own ideas, and the strain of doing so makes it unlikely
  that I will be in a fit state to continue writing once I have hit upon the perfect
  title for the story of my own life. Of course, if I was able to get my hands on
  the Cordial Balm of Siriacum (see O Cure Me, below, 6th March) that might provide
  the fillip I need, and I would be able to type away energetically, regaling you
  with anecdotes from my past, attempting an amusing yet cogent dissection of my current
  state, and even looking forward to the future with the aid of psychic messages from
  a squirrel. I beg you to wait patiently, therefore, while I seek a reliable supply
  of the Cordial Balm. When I have done so, I shall continue with my potted autobiography.


  WAS DOBSON A VISIONARY?

  Was Dobson a visionary? William Blake saw an angel in a tree in Peckham. Dobson,
  so far as we know, never went to Peckham. But did he see other angels, in other
  trees, elsewhere? If he did, he never wrote about them. He wrote about all sorts
  of things--propellers, dust, ringworm, Rod McKuen, spillages, gloom and magnetism,
  for example.

  Dobson''s pamphlet on Rod McKuen is one of his most extraordinary works. He took
  a single line from a poem by the gravel-voiced bard of sentimental pap and spun
  from it a dizzying exegesis. The critic Lavender Thule has praised Dobson''s essay
  as the verbal equivalent of a bebop jazz improvisation, although as she is profoundly
  deaf, and has been since birth, one wonders how she arrived at this conclusion.
  One wonders, too, why she treasures a crumpled photograph of the jazz-obsessed armaments
  manufacturer Chevenix Peaglue on the back of which she has scribbled an illegible
  couplet.


  Hedgehog lover Rod McKuen

  The line Dobson chose as the starting point for his majestic pamphlet is from Rod
  McKuen''s poem "Mornings Enough", where the cloying versifier writes: The hedgehog
  grumbling back to darkness is known by me and loved by me. In sweeping prose. Dobson
  notes that sleeping hedgehogs are often torn to pieces by badgers, and ponders on
  savagery in the world of small mammals. Would McKuen, he asks, declare his love
  for a badger with bloody fangs, fresh from gorging itself on the entrails of a recently-slaughtered
  hedgehog? From there, the out of print pamphleteer poses a series of questions about
  love, badgers, blood, gravel pathways, wax, being unstinting about something, pantomime,
  poisonous toads, The Duchess of Malfi, gloves, fruit with pips, fruit without pips,
  and the methods we use to measure horses. It is a bravura performance, even though
  Dobson refuses to answer any of the questions he raises.

  Indeed, on page sixty-six he writes "I refuse to answer any of these questions.
  You can put me in a sack and seal the sack with knotted rope, and fling the sack
  containing me into a dark and horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea,
  but I shall remain steadfast in my silence!!!"

  Why did Dobson choose to end that sentence with three exclamation marks? Do I know
  the answer to that question? If I do, will I tell you? Or will I, like Dobson, invite
  you to put me in a sack and seal the sack with knotted rope, and fling the sack
  containing me into a dark and horrible pond, or even into the vast abominable sea?


  SHIPSHAPE


  The picture above is of a ship, and thus gives a perfect illustration of the quality
  of being shipshape. If an object''s form is roughly akin to the ship shown, we can
  say with some confidence that it is shipshape. Shipshape ought not be confused with
  shapeshift. To shapeshift, the verb, means to engage in shapeshifting, a practice
  of which various phantoms and ghouls are fond, the better to terrify us with intimations
  of the uncanny. Ah, I hear you say, but is that not precisely what might happen
  on a ghost ship, where one may encounter shipshape and shapeshift in the same context?
  I can only answer in the affirmative.

  Ghost ships are a particularly chilling subcategory of ghoulish terror, but what
  are they exactly? Some contend that a ghost ship need have no phantoms nor shapeshifters
  aboard, but earns the description merely by being abandoned, emptied in a mysterious
  fashion of all life, save perhaps for a few rats scurrying in the cargo holds. The
  classic example is the Marie Celeste, which owes its fame to Arthur Conan Doyle''s
  story J. Habakuk Jephson''s Statement (1884), based on the case of the Mary Celeste,
  which had been found, intact but deserted, twelve years earlier.

  Then there are true ghost ships, ones crewed by phantoms and ghouls, often piratical
  in nature, and usually seen at night, or in gales. The archetype here is The Flying
  Dutchman, not to be confused with Die Fledermaus, or flying mouse, which is a literal
  translation of the German for bat, and the name of Strauss''s comic operetta of
  1874, which has nothing to do with aerial Netherlanders, as far as I recall.Bats,
  poor innocent creatures that they are, have often been considered spooky and terrifying
  by people who ought to know better. Hanging upside down in a dark cave is not in
  itself evidence of ghoulishness, particularly if you are a bat.

  I appear to have become diverted from the subject of shapeshifters aboard shipshape
  ships, and I apologise. Introducing bats into the equation--as they say in management
  gobbledegook seminars, using the phrase irksomely when there is not a single equation
  in sight--is only going to make matters more complex than they already are. In any
  case, if we begin to talk of bats, it will not be long before we need to differentiate
  bat, the flying mammal fond of hanging upside down in a dark cave, from bat, the
  tool with which a ball is propelled and controlled in any number of sports and games,
  and we will soon get on to racquets and rackets. As Lord Denning said in another
  context, "this is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land
  would say that it cannot be right that these actions should go any further". For
  "actions" read "blatherings".

  If a ghost ship can be either one with a ghost crew, or one uncannily deserted,
  there is only one type of ship that can be described as a ship of fools, and that
  is a ship on which both passengers and crew are, to be blunt, fools. Hieronymus
  Bosch painted a ship of fools, and Sebastian Brant wrote a satire of that title
  in 1494. It is a medieval allegory that has had surprising resonance.

  Typically audacious, the poet Dennis Beerpint has crammed all these legends together
  in his new verse drama The Abandoned Ship Of Fools And Ghouls. In a key scene, the
  derelict ship, no longer entirely shipshape, is discovered in a bat-riddled cave.
  Phantoms haunt the decks of the barquentine, while deeper inside the cave, the unnamed
  narrator discovers fools capering about and making a racket, playing a ball game
  with racquets. In a twist that will delight readers given to plot-twists, the narrator
  himself then shifts shape. Here are the closing lines:

  So we leave this ship, so highly vaunted / By ghouls and phantoms now so haunted
  / We press on through the bat-dark cave / And pray to God our souls to save / We
  come to where the fools do caper / And I shift shape--I dissolve in vapour.

  Most critics have dismissed Beerpint''s latest work as pap, and one can hardly blame
  them.'
