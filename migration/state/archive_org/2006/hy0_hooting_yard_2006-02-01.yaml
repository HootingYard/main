full_text: 'SOME NOTES ON COMPARTMENTS

  Dear Mr Key, writes the ever-curious Tim Thurn, In last Thursday''s piece entitled
  Google News (26 January, see below) you make passing mention of the Blotzmann Compartments
  controversy of 1934. I confess that I have no idea what a Blotzmann Compartment
  is, or was, and would be extremely grateful if you could enlighten me.

  Well, Tim, I will do my best, but I warn you that getting to grips with Blotzmann
  Compartments is no easy matter. Have you ever looked into the fathomless black pools
  of an owl''s eyes? If you have, you will know that eerie sense of confronting an
  unutterably alien, cold, unyielding energy. It was this sense of otherness that
  motivated Blotzmann when he built the first of the notorious Compartments.

  We still have some of his working notes, but they help us little, couched as they
  are in a dense academic (or pseudoacademic) language which may have made no sense
  even to Blotzmann. Phrases such as "by extension, most advanced peristomal border
  plating is noted for an unusual hydropore/gonopore in the axismal interray and the
  position of juvenile, summit-mounted proximal tegmens and theca" flummox the best
  of brains. We do know that whenever Blotzmann constructed a Compartment, he made
  sure a fully functioning Thanatophore was primed and ready in the corner of his
  workshop.

  As he learned to manipulate the Compartments, Blotzmann became more open about his
  intentions. He introduced a swivelling panel on the top of each Compartment, allowing
  viewers the opportunity for a fleeting glimpse of activity within. The panels were
  attached to a small motor fixed to the side of the Compartment, powered from a source
  which Blotzmann always refused to divulge, though it is likely to have been a simple
  dry cell battery. It may even have been a wet cell battery, if such a thing exists.
  Knowing nothing of batteries and their workings, I am reluctant to say any more
  about this for the time being.

  Arriving at the optimal size of the Compartments was a hit and miss affair, which
  usually found Blotzmann gritting his teeth. A study by Howl and Flapper determined
  that the smallest Compartment could fit inside a standard pastry carton, while the
  largest one known to exist blotted out the moon and the stars. This reminds us of
  Blotzmann''s insistence that his Compartments were never exposed to daylight, leading
  to absurd accusations in the gutter press that there was vampiric intent behind
  the entire project.

  Fire and flood destroyed all the Blotzmann Compartments one by one, over a period
  of seventeen years. Blotzmann was sanguine. He himself had the black eyes of an
  owl, and hair that resembled feathers. Make of that what you will. You would not
  be the first to posit a madcap theory.


  VOX POP : A PANG HILL ORPHAN SPEAKS


  My name is Sago and I am a glum inmate of Pang Hill Orphanage. I was born in a faraway
  land. My papa was a crusty man who fell into a pond and never surfaced. Later they
  found a vent at the bottom of the pond which led to a chute which in turn led to
  a hideous abode of Doom. My mama collected flies and fleas and similar wee beasts,
  often but not always winged ones. One day, soon after papa plunged down the chute
  at the bottom of the pond, she took a little paper bag with some of her flies in
  it to the parliament building of that faraway land, and when she showed reluctance
  to open the bag to the security guards at the magnetic barrier in the lobby, they
  shot her dead. That is the kind of land I come from.

  I spent a few months living off berries and rainwater and living in a cave on the
  coastline. Then the captain of an illegal fishing smack scooped me out of the tide
  pool where I was happily paddling and brought me thousands of miles across the storm-tossed
  ocean and delivered me to the gates of Pang Hill Orphanage. That is my story in
  its broad outlines. I would tell you more, but it is time for my morning brain scan.
  No one at the Orphanage has ever explained to me why each orphan''s brain is scanned
  three times a day, but I have made a plasticine copy of the key to the room behind
  the canteen in which lurk the filing cabinets where the brain scan results are stored,
  and soon I am going to skulk in there at dead of night and examine all the results
  very, very closely and then I am going to shred them, for I fear nobody and nothing.
  I am glum but stupendously brave and clever, and my name is Sago.


  TINY LITTLE HANDS, DECISIVE MUSTACHIOS

  Much of the work of the Russian composer Alexander Scriabin (1872-1915) was written
  for piano. This is surprising when one considers how tiny his hands were. Indeed,
  there were two occasions during his short, fraught life when he injured them while
  relentlessly practising piano pieces which called for hands larger than his own.

  Tiny his hands may have been, but this puny neurasthenic Russian cultivated a pair
  of decisive mustachios.


  Among his orchestral works, the Poem of Ecstasy, opus 54, is a supremely bonkers
  piece which, long before Spinal Tap, goes up to eleven. One critic imagined he was
  hearing a graphic portrayal of the players all having sex with each other. Another
  refers to the "malignant sneers from muted trombones... was music ever more evil-sounding"?

  Not everyone appreciated Scriabin at the time, of course. The man who was chosen
  to conduct the premiere of his Second Symphony complained "After Scriabin, Wagner
  lisps sweetly like a suckling babe. I think that I will go mad any moment now. Where
  can one hide from such music? Help me!"

  My favourite Scriabin piece is the Mysterium. This was designed as a total art work,
  involving an orchestra, dance, light, and exotic perfumes, to be performed in the
  Himalayas, its playing ushering in Armageddon. Mysterium would be "a grandiose religious
  synthesis of all arts which would herald the birth of a new world" and the emergence
  of a Nietzschean Superman. Whether this Superman would have tiny little hands and
  decisive mustachios we do not know, for Scriabin succumbed to septicemia when the
  composition was barely begun. It thus has a place in the museum of lost or non-existent
  works of art, about which I shall write more soon.


  ANOTHER VLASTO

  Last Tuesday, in The Gnawed And The Chewed (see below), we met Vlasto Pismire, the
  Lembit Opik lookalike whose incessant prattling transfixed Dobson for months and
  months. Vlasto Pismire is not to be confused with another Vlasto, to whom we now
  turn.

  Vlasto Cuddy was a tall, stooping sort of person who spent most of his time standing
  on top of a crate, by numberless kerbs and roadsides, elegantly attired, flailing
  his spookily long arms, pontificating at passers-by.

  He sounds familiar... but I can''t quite place him.

  Possibly you do not recognise the name. Very, very few people knew him as Vlasto
  Cuddy, for he became familiar to thousands, perhaps even millions, under his sobriquet,
  the Pontificating Fruitarian.

  Ah yes! That rings a bell.

  Many bells, I expect. Vlasto Cuddy the Pontificating Fruitarian spent more than
  fifty years declaiming his blinkered dietary opinions to the passing throng. Sometimes
  the throng passed more quickly than was seemly. Sometimes it could hardly be called
  a throng at all. Sometimes there were torrential downpours, and at other times the
  light of the big bright sun battered mercilessly upon the face of the earth, and
  in these and all other weather conditions there would be a roadside somewhere in
  the world where at dawn of day a tall, stooping sort of person would deposit his
  crate and clamber atop it and begin his fruit-related pontificating, and scarcely
  cease until night fell down.

  Remind me of the nature of his pontificating.

  By all means. Vlasto Cuddy would shout, for example, that pride and lust, a corrupt
  pride of heart, and a furious filthy lust of body, are the non-fruitarian''s springs
  of action, a desire to act the beast without control, and live like a devil without
  a check of conscience, his only reasons for opposing the existence of fruit. He
  would thunder that a world of creatures are up in arms against the non-fruit eater,
  to kill him as they would a venomous mad dog. He called those who eschew plums and
  tangerines absurd fools, beasts, dirty monsters, brutes, gloomy dark animals, enemies
  of humankind, wolves to civil society, butchers and murderers of the human race.
  Moreover, he who eats anything other than lemons and other citrus fruits is cursed
  in the following hearty terms--"Let the glorious mass of fire burn him, let the
  moon light him to the gallows, let the stars in their courses fight against the
  wretch who eats other than fruit, let the force of the comets dash him to pieces,
  let the roar of thunders strike him deaf, let red lightnings blast his guilty soul,
  let the sea lift up her mighty waves to bury him, let the lion tear him to pieces,
  let dogs devour him, let the air poison him, let the next crumb of bread choke him,
  nay, let the dull ass spurn him to death."

  I remember now. I was always puzzled by that last bit, for I do not think it possible
  to die simply from being spurned by an ass. Had the Pontificating Fruitarian done
  his research?

  He had indeed. Vlasto Cuddy''s sister, the Divine Miss Patience Cuddy, rose to prominence
  in the world of donkey rearing, and she often conducted experiments in which volunteers
  from a nearby orphanage subjected themselves to spurning by asses and donkeys. Some
  died as a result.

  Surely that cannot be so!

  I grant there was talk in the taverns that the Divine Miss Patience may have falsified
  some of her data, but nothing was ever proven.

  Tell me, was the Divine Miss Patience a fruitarian like her tall, stooping brother?

  No she was not. His pontifications were lost on her, for he was forever roaming
  the world with his crate, while she rarely ventured far from her donkey compound
  on the banks of the river that runs through Ack.

  Did Vlasto Cuddy the Pontificating Fruitarian never commit any of his pontifications
  to paper? Did he not take a leaf out of Dobson''s book, that is to say, and publish
  his pontifications as pamphlets?

  He did not, for the surprising fact is that Vlasto Cuddy was functionally illiterate.
  It is said that he never had time to learn to read or write because he was far too
  busy concentrating all the powers of his formidable mind upon the subject of fruit.

  Will you be introducing readers to further Vlastos in addition to Vlasto Pismire
  and Vlasto Cuddy?

  Not if I can help it.



  SURGEON''S BISCUIT

  Some people think Surgeon''s Biscuit is the name of a town near Kakadamm. Others
  believe it is an old parlour game popular in the boarding houses of seaside resorts
  during the 1930s. There are those who suspect it to be the name of a racehorse,
  or perhaps a racing pigeon, or some other bird or beast of swiftness. Surgeon''s
  Biscuit is, of course, none of these things. It is simply a biscuit that belonged
  to a surgeon.

  But what a biscuit! And what a surgeon! As biscuits go, it was the finest specimen
  the surgeon had ever seen. Two thirds of the way down a perfectly ordinary-looking
  packet of digestive crumblies, there it nestled, a numinous, almost golden thing,
  some quirk in its baking making it unutterably different from its fellows in the
  batch. He remembered when he first handled it. He was not a man to transfer his
  newly-purchased biscuits into a so-called "biscuit tin" or similar container. He
  ate them straight from the packet, as he had been brought up to do by his rough,
  tough parents in their rough, tough hovel, who can never have expected little Vladimir
  to grow up to become an important surgeon. So on that day, during the last pathetic
  gasps of the Nixon administration, he took the next biscuit from the pack without
  even looking at it. Sitting at his large important desk in his spacious important
  consulting rooms, his attention was fixed on page forty six, column two, line fifteen
  of The Haemoglobin Monitor, where his name appeared, misspelled yet again! Why was
  it, he wondered, slowly moving the fabulous biscuit from the opened packet towards
  his mouth, that despite being the country''s most famous surgeon, despite being
  referred to in virtually every haemoglobin-related article of note for the past
  three decades, not a single medical journal ever managed to spell his name correctly?
  He was about to bite his biscuit when something stopped him. A black beetle crawled
  across the magazine page, and came to a dead halt on his name. Vladimir shuddered,
  as if this were some presentiment of doom (which it was) and ditched his biscuit-eating
  plan. And it was then that he looked at the biscuit for the first time. He had been
  holding it for perhaps eight or nine seconds without paying it the least attention.
  Now, as the black beetle sat still on his misspelled name, dying of a rare black
  beetle disease, he not only saw the biscuit but felt it. Indeed, all his senses
  apprehended this majestic biscuit. And a spark lit up in his brain, just as the
  last spark in the black beetle''s brain was extinguished, and he said to himself,
  "I am a great surgeon, and this is a great biscuit! Rather than bite into it and
  chew it and digest this digestive crumbly, I am going to put it in a box and preserve
  it, and it will forever after be known as the Surgeon''s Biscuit!"

  Some say the soul of the black beetle escaped its dead shell and imbued the biscuit
  at that very instant. But black beetles do not have souls, and the biscuit was just
  a biscuit, and Vladimir himself was only an average surgeon, albeit a surgeon of
  enormous learning in the field of haemoglobin, but a surgeon with a deluded and
  preposterous sense of self-importance.

  And that is the real story of Surgeon''s Biscuit.


  FIFTY YEARS AGO

  Hard to credit, but it was exactly fifty years ago today that Dobson, the out-of-print
  pamphleteer, made his one and only appearance on the radio. He was booked to appear
  on the then popular show Bad Gas And Forts, a sort of uncategorisable hour of talk,
  static and field recordings hosted by an anonymous spook known only as The Gravel-Voiced
  Ghoul.

  Dobson''s participation was the result of a long campaign by Marigold Chew, who
  spent months standing outside the producer''s office building, holding a flag and
  haranguing passers-by to sign a petition. The producer had sworn an oath that Dobson
  would never appear on the show, apparently because of some otherwise forgotten incident
  involving a rowing boat and a flock of bitterns. Marigold Chew was eventually able
  to prove that the oath contravened the ancient law of civil and pursuivant debaling,
  and it was struck down by magisterium bossa nova in Chancery.

  The show was broadcast live, and no recording was made. However, by pasting together
  the shreds of a hastily-scribbled transcription, it is possible to get some idea
  of what took place. The Ghoul''s first guest was an elderly writer who had defected
  from the Soviet Union. In the immediate post-revolutionary period, he had written
  a series of heart-warming tales about a peasant family under the title Little Yurt
  On The Tundra. With the suppression of the kulaks, and under pressure from the Comintern,
  he rewrote these works as Little Foundry On The Collective Farm. If the transcript
  is reliable, the remarks he made were punctuated by loud hammering noises.

  After about ten minutes, the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul introduced Dobson. Asked to continue
  the theme of cloying family-centred story-telling, the pamphleteer embarked on a
  lengthy anecdote about the books his ma read to him as a child. Here, as far as
  can be pieced together, is what he said:

  "My ma was a huge fan of detective fiction, so my bedtime stories tended to be whatever
  she was reading at the time. One of her favourites was Dorothy Sleet, who wrote
  a series of whodunits featuring Rex Shroud, Orrery Sleuth. Shroud was a sleuth all
  of whose cases involved an orrery at some point in the story. What is that hammering
  noise? Sleet created one of the classic detectives, I think. He may not be quite
  on a par with M P Shiel''s Prince Zaleski, but she put a lot of thought into giving
  the Orrery Sleuth all sorts of idiosyncrasies to make him a memorable and fully-rounded
  character, not just a solver of puzzles. He has a false lung, too many teeth, and
  is a daily practitioner of Baxterism. His lantern is ruby red. At moments of high
  desperation, he will invariably fiddle about with a little tin of talcum powder.
  He keeps blotting paper in his pocket and that hammering is really getting on my
  nerves. Perhaps the best story Dorothy Sleet ever wrote was The Orrery Sleuth And
  The Pod People From The Weird Parallel World Out Of Time And Space. You think you''re
  reading science fiction, but that''s just narrative pyrotechnics. It is, I think,
  both valiant and boisterous, as the best prose always tries to be. She was a woman
  of baleful countenance, Dorothy Sleet, and kept many tortoises in her seaside bungalow.
  She married four times, and each of her husbands vanished unaccountably. The first
  three simply vapourised in the kitchen while making omelettes, and the fourth was
  last seen in Ireland, in the vicinity of the Wobbling Virgin of Ballinspittle."

  At this point the hammering noises drowned out Dobson. By the time they stopped,
  the show had come to an end, and listeners were treated to a concert by Xavier Cugat
  and His Orchestra. Dobson never received a fee for his appearance. Some years later,
  he and the Gravel-Voiced Ghoul passed each other in the street. They did not acknowledge
  each other.


  A Philosopher Giving That Lecture On The Orrery In Which A Lamp Is Put In Place
  Of The Sun by Joseph Wright, 1766. An orrery is called an orrery because one of
  the first ones was made for Charles Boyle (1676-1731), the Fourth Earl of Orrery.'
