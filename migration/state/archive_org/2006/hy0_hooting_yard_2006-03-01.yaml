full_text: 'BUCEPHALUS AND THE CEPHALOPODS IN THE BOSPHORUS

  The weather was foul on that day in the Ancient World, that Thursday when an unaccompanied
  horse cantered to a halt at the bank of a mighty waterway. The horse was Alexander
  the Great''s steed Bucephalus, sent by the Macedonian hero for a recuperative holiday.
  The river was the Bosphorus, the strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara.

  Alexander was a firm believer in horse holidays. When young, Bucephalus had been
  skittish and temperamental, frightened of his own shadow, and Alexander''s ministrations
  had becalmed him, but even as the mature horse he was now, there were times when
  he needed a break from campaigning and battle. Thus it was that Alexander had waved
  him off to--as he put it--"enjoy the mysteriously sultry atmosphere of a few nights
  by the Bosphorus"*.


  Bucephalus

  But it was not night-time, sultry or otherwise, when Bucephalus arrived at his destination.
  It was day, bleak, grey, and wretched, and the majestic horse stood still at the
  river''s edge, snorting. Alexander the Great did not expect him back in Macedonia
  for a week. Remember this is the Ancient World, so such landmarks as line the Bosphorus
  as the Galata tower, the palaces of Dolmabahce, Ciragan, Yildiz, and Beylerbeyi,
  the Rumeli and Anatolian Fortresses, and the Kuleli Military High School had not
  yet been built. Bucephalus began to trot, following the river''s course, hoping
  to find a field where he could have a restful time munching nutritious foliage.

  It was late afternoon on that Thursday when the horse decided to rest, and planted
  his hooves in the mud at the edge of the Bosphorus where today one finds the Bogazici
  suspension toll bridge. He noticed a churning in the waters of the mighty river,
  and turned his horse-head to look more intently. He was astonished to see a tangle
  of cephalopods thrashing around in the river, cephalopods large and small, octopuses,
  squids, cuttlefish and chambered nautiluses, emitting clouds of ink, tentacles flailing.
  What were they doing upriver, rather than in the dark, cold abysses of the sea?
  Were they lost, and did this explain their frantic activity? Cephalopods are probably
  the most intelligent of invertebrates, with huge pulsating brains, and it is easy
  to imagine that the realisation of being lost in the Bosphorus could induce panic
  among them.


  Bosphorus

  Bucephalus had devoted his life to the service of Alexander the Great, but now he
  wondered how he might help these strange sea-creatures, so much more ancient than
  he, or Alexander, or even the Ancient World in which he lived. Could he somehow
  take them all back to the sea, and release them into the vast pitiless oceans that
  were their natural home, from the warm waters of the tropics to the icy chill of
  the poles? Being a horse, Bucephalus could not think how he might lay a trail of
  plankton and krill for the cephalopods to pursue. He could not think of any way
  at all to lead them to the sea. So on the spur of the moment, he decided to gallop
  back to Macedonia, to fetch Alexander the Great, confident that his master would
  know exactly what to do.

  Alas! When he got to Macedonia, Bucephalus was told that Alexander was in the ancient
  Phrygian capital of Gordium, puzzling out how to undo the Gordian knot so he could
  become the future King of Asia. So the brave horse charged tirelessly onward, collected
  Alexander--who had either worked out how to undo the knot or just hacked it apart
  with his sword, depending on whose story you believe--and sped with him all the
  way back to the Bosphorus.

  When they got there, they found no sign of the cephalopods. If a horse can feel
  sheepish, Bucephalus certainly did. He watched as Alexander dismounted and strode
  off, his armour clanking, into the field where the horse had munched his lunch.
  The Macedonian warlord plucked a plant from the earth and brought it to over to
  the horse.


  Cephalopods

  "This, Bucephalus, is henbane. It is not only the bane of hens, but of horses too.
  One day, when the Ancient World has passed away and the new times are known as mediaeval,
  it will be used in the brews concocted by witches to cause visual hallucinations
  and the sensation of flight. This I know." Alexander smiled and patted Bucephalus
  affectionately on the mane. "Poor deluded horse," he continued, "You saw no cephalopods.
  You were seeing visions of things that cannot be. Come, let us return to Macedonia
  at a canter, and I will give you healthy hay to eat."

  And as night fell on the sultry, mysterious Bosphorus, Alexander and Bucephalus
  began their long journey home. And in the depths of the river, the waters stirred,
  and a squid slithered through a tiny crack in a riverbed rock, its black, fathomless,
  malevolent eyes piercing the underwater world, long long ago, and far into the future,
  for eternity.

  *NOTE : Alexander the Great is here paraphrasing a line from Anthea Bell''s translation
  of Twilight by Stefan Zweig, published by the Pushkin Press, and highly recommended.
  There is a photograph of Herr Zweig and his wife tucked away in the Hooting Yard
  archive for August 2004.

  FURTHER NOTE: If you want to keep up with the very latest in the world of squids,
  nautiluses, octopuses and cuttlefish, I recommend Cephalopod News.

  An audio version of this story, declaimed by the author, will shortly be available
  as a cephalopodcast.


  RAINER WERNER RINGBINDER

  Rainer Werner Ringbinder did not invent the ring-binder, but he claimed to have
  done so. He also tried to take credit for being the first person on earth to devise
  staplers, hole-punches, treasury tags, pencil sharpeners, and all sorts of other
  stationery items which, alas, are falling into desuetude as administrators and office
  workers spend more and more time staring at screens and less and less time fiddling
  about with tangible things.


  Oskar Homolka

  Rainer Werner Ringbinder was a heavy-set man with cow-like eyes, who looked a little
  like Oskar Homolka, the Viennese actor who played Verloc in Alfred Hitchcock''s
  Sabotage (1936), an adaptation of Joseph Conrad''s The Secret Agent (1907). Confusingly,
  Hitchcock made a film called Secret Agent (also 1936), which was nothing to do with
  Conrad''s novel, and also Saboteur (1942), which was nothing to do with Sabotage.
  Secret Agent (film, not book) starred John Gielgud, Peter Lorre, and Percy Marchmont,
  none of whom looked like Rainer Werner Ringbinder at all.

  Peter Lorre''s daughter Catherine nearly fell victim to the so-called "Hillside
  Stranglers", Angelo Buono and Kenneth Bianchi, but was left unharmed when the fiends
  realised that her father''s status as a film star would mean unwelcome publicity
  for their homicidal frenzy. It goes to show that having the right name can get you
  out of all sorts of trouble, even when it isn''t the right name at all. In St Petersburg
  in 1918, the writer William Gerhardie was about to be set upon by a tangle of angry
  Bolsheviks when one of them recognised him and pointed out to his pals that it was
  "Geerhardi, Geerhardi". Mistaking the foppish young Englishman for Kier Hardie,
  founder of the Labour Party and socialist saint, the revolutionaries shook Gerhardie
  by the hand instead of tearing him limb from limb.

  Gerhardie''s first novel was Futility (1922), and this would have made an apposite
  title for a biography of Rainer Werner Ringbinder, were anyone foolish enough to
  write one. A man like Ringbinder does not have "friends", exactly, but the closest
  he came to one was his acquaintance Pryce Montmarch (not to be confused with Percy
  Marchmont), who said: "Everything about Rainer Werner was futile, from his cradle
  to his grave. He was the most hopelessly unnecessary person I ever met. Why he pretended
  to have invented many standard items of stationery is anybody''s guess. The infuriating
  thing is that he had a first class intellect, and he squandered it on futility."

  And so the seasons turn and the globe spins on its axis, and so dust settles on
  the past, and on tangible things, and still stars blaze with light in the boundless
  firmament.


  HOOTING YARD ON THE AIR : THE PODCASTS

  If you have been reading this website with due care, you will know that I broadcast
  a weekly half hour show on ResonanceFM, London''s finest radio station. The show
  goes out live, which means that my reading is sometimes accompanied by banging,
  crashing, and buzzing noises, or interrupted by me having a choking fit, or by other
  disturbances. That seems to me far more exciting than a rehearsed, cleaned-up recording.
  You will also know, particularly if you are a pod person, that the archive of past
  shows is being made available in the form of podcasts, which you can have sent to
  your computer before transferring to your pod.

  Here is a link to the Resonance home page, and here is one to the podcast page.

  Anyway, I thought it might interest you to know how the podcasts are created. Many
  people think that it is simply a case of taking the archived recording of a show
  and making it available as an mp3 file. Would that it were so simple! The truth
  is that in order for the original live broadcast to be made podcastable, a number
  of extremely delicate and complicated operations need to be carried out. And that
  is why, about once a month, I am summoned at dead of night to the gleaming high-tech
  skyscraper wherein lurks ResonanceFM''s podcasting maestro.

  The first time I went there, it took me about an hour to find him, for the skyscraper
  is enormous and wholly lacking in informative signage. What signs there are are
  either baffling or redundant. I do not know why this is so, and I have never had
  the courage to ask. I have learned to accept that the front desk in the lobby is
  labelled, simply, The Front Desk In The Lobby, and that the person sitting at the
  desk wears a badge reading The Person Sitting At The Front Desk In The Lobby. This
  person has not been authorised to answer any questions whatsoever, so when, on this
  first night-time visit, I asked "Where will I find the podcasting maestro?", I may
  as well have been shouting into the wind, as indeed I was, for the lobby acts as
  both lobby and experimental wind tunnel. Apparently, sound recordings are made of
  the wind in preparation for one of the podcasting maestro''s planned podcasts, tentatively
  titled "Wind In A Wind Tunnel".

  Now I was used to the more homespun atmosphere of the station''s main studio and
  was somewhat unnerved by the grandiosity of my surroundings. I took a chance, however,
  walked past the person sitting at the front desk in the lobby (who was immersed
  in reading a battered copy of Stockhausen Serves Imperialism by Cornelius Cardew),
  took the lift up--hitting a floor number at random--and skittered off down the corridor
  I found myself in. There were numerous doors along this corridor, all marked Door.
  There was also, I noticed, an overpowering smell of guinea pig, though I saw no
  guinea pigs, and have seen none on my subsequent visits. I pushed open doors at
  random, and peeked into each room, hoping to discover the Resonance podcast maestro,
  but all I found were bales of fusewire, discarded yoghurt cartons, and toy crustaceans
  made of plasticine. There was a lobster that took my fancy, but it was high up on
  a shelf and I have an aversion to teetering on step-ladders.

  I think I checked every room on that floor before getting back into the lift and
  choosing another level, again at random. This one was different. It had no corridor,
  just a vast open plan area--with a sign, of course, reading A Vast Open Plan Area--empty
  except for a small patch of ectoplasm.

  I said that it took me about an hour wandering the skyscraper to find the podcast
  maestro, but in truth he found me. I was stumbling fretfully around what seemed
  like the umpteenth floor when I heard a loud electronic crackling noise, and then
  a disembodied voice.

  "Podcast maestro to Frank Key! Podcast maestro to Frank Key! Floor 96, Rectangle
  Zone!" it called, so that is where I went.

  The podcast maestro was sitting at a console from which occasional puffs of vapour
  jetted up to the ceiling and slowly dispersed. He was wearing a metal hat and taking
  ravenous bites from a toffee apple.

  "Glad you could make it," he said, "You''d better put on these mittens," and he
  tossed a pair of mittens to me. They were woven from a material I was unable to
  identify, and I worried for a moment that I might suffer an allergic reaction, for
  in the past I have had allergic reactions to mittens woven from unfamiliar materials.
  On this occasion, however, all was well.

  The podcast maestro, with a great deal of effort, pulled a big lever on his console,
  to no apparent purpose.

  "Now," he said, "It is nearly three o'' clock in the morning. At precisely two minutes
  past, we will begin effecting the transfer of one of your past shows into podcastable
  format. It should take about an hour. You will need to attune the flimflam and steady
  the rattling. Just watch me, you''ll soon get the idea."

  And do you know what? He was right. I did, and by four o'' clock we had a complete
  recording of Hooting Yard On the Air all ready for podcasting. Since then, I have
  been back to the skyscraper regularly, whenever I get the summons on my metal tapping
  machine. I would not say that I have become friends with the podcast maestro exactly,
  for there is something formidable about him, emphasised by his metal hat, but we
  do engage in affable banter as the clock ticks towards 3.02 a.m. After that, of
  course, we are silent, concentrated, utterly involved in our task. And I hope that
  the pod people among you, when you listen to each new podcast, are also silent,
  concentrated, and utterly involved, borne away from the dull cares of your day into
  the realms of instructive and sensible prose.


  COLOSSUS

  It has been said that Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, bestrode the 20th century
  like a colossus. This claim was first made by Dobson himself, when still a young
  man. At the age of twenty, he published a pamphlet resoundingly titled Why I Shall
  Bestride This Century Like A Colossus. It is a curious work, out of print of course,
  a thin tract with a picture of a whooper swan on the cover. It begins thus:

  I shall bestride this century like a colossus. My name will ring out like a clarion.
  In years to come, whenever two or three are gathered together to discuss pamphleteers,
  there will be but one name on their lips: Dobson!

  Such self-belief, in so callow a youth, is touching. Looking back, in his dotage,
  Dobson found it touching too, and he took to sitting with his one remaining copy
  of the pamphlet clutched to his chest, sobbing uncontrollably for hours on end.
  When Marigold Chew found him thus, she flung open the windows, whatever the weather,
  and stamped around the room singing loud, tuneless sea shanties, ones that involved
  pirates, cutlasses, bilgewater, tattered sailcloth, salt, seaweed, hard tack biscuits,
  foghorns, sirens, rigging, anchors, and shipwreck. Invariably, Dobson''s self-pitying
  lassitude would be broken, and he would hurl the curiously pristine pamphlet towards
  the fireplace, wipe away his tears, don his Bolivian military boots and his Stalinist
  cardigan, and crash out of the house to go on one of his jaunts.

  Dobson''s jaunts, in the latter part of his life, usually took him to the nearest
  pig sty, but there was one occasion when he headed off in a different direction.
  He walked so far that day that he came upon a shining city on a hill, a city where
  all the streets had two names, one both illegible and unpronounceable, and the other
  devised by Yoko Ono as part of an art project to promote world peace. Postal delivery
  persons in that city were required by law to learn all the double street names by
  heart, or to face summary dismissal if they failed. Often, those who did fail--and
  there were many--would flounce around on the outskirts of the city warning travellers
  away. It was a paltry sort of revenge, and seldom succeeded, for the delights of
  that shining city on a hill attracted wayfarers from near and far, daily, in their
  thousands. It is a wonder that Dobson had never been there before this particular
  Tuesday.

  A dismissed postal delivery person stopped the out of print pamphleteer as he was
  about to cross a pontoon bridge that would take him in to the most boisterous quarter
  of the city.

  "Go no further, old man," said this vengeful figure, whose yellow skin scarcely
  covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath. His hair was of a lustrous black,
  and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed
  a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour
  as the dun white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion, and
  his straight black lips. His voice was booming and monotonous, empty of human expression
  and lacking any variation in tone or cadence. "This city you approach is no place
  for out of print pamphleteers."

  Ever sensitive to warnings from spooks and wraiths, Dobson turned around and went
  home. He found Marigold Chew in the back garden, drilling holes in an enormous sheet
  of corrugated cardboard.

  "I was warned away from a shining city on a hill," he said, "Is it a city you have
  visited?"

  Marigold Chew stopped drilling, reset the safety catch, and removed her protective
  goggles.

  "You are a foolish old man in your dotage, Dobson," she said, though there was kindness
  in her voice, "And it is well you were warned away, for that city you think you
  saw is illusory. Some say the hill it sits atop is hollow, and harbours within it
  heaven, and some say hell. Either way, I am pleased to see you home. Let us clear
  the nettles from the vegetable patch."

  That was what happened on that Tuesday towards the end of the 20th century. Did
  Dobson indeed bestride it as a colossus? He was not the only person to think so,
  but the names of the others escape me for the time being. When I remember them,
  I will tell you.

  That piece, an earlier version of which first appeared last year, has been chosen
  as a set text for the entrance examinations to Bodger''s Spinney Infant School.
  Here are some sample questions likely to be faced by the tiny candidates:

  1. Imagine you are the dismissed postal delivery person who encounters Dobson by
  the pontoon bridge. Would you have handled the situation in the same way? Think
  about what you would have said to the out of print pamphleteer, then translate it
  into Latin.

  2. Do you think Yoko Ono''s unnecessary double-naming of the streets in the shining
  city on the hill would make a significant contribution to world peace? Give reasons
  for your answer in terse, cogent prose, then translate that into Latin too.

  3. Give a brief account of the career of David Blunkett, with special reference
  to his second resignation speech and tearful use of the phrase "the little lad".
  Or was that the first resignation speech?

  4. If you could bestride a century like a colossus, which century would you choose
  so to bestride, and why? Extra marks will be awarded if you turn pale, gnaw the
  end of your pencil in desperation, and crumple to the floor, twitching and shattered.


  DISPENSE, DISPENSE!

  I have never really understood, or cared about, computer hacking. As far as I can
  gather it is a world of socially inept and probably sociopathic young men who ought
  to spend more time in the shower. But I learned something recently which means I
  am going to have to take a crash course in computer science and become a hacker,
  for I intend to wheedle my way into the systems of all the major high street banks.

  I hope Hooting Yard readers know me better than to think there is some vulgar financial
  motive behind my plan. Of course there isn''t! I do, however, need to be able to
  access the throbbing electronic brain which controls untold thousands of cashpoints,
  or cash dispensers, or ATMs, or whatever you wish to call them.

  Why? Because I want to make every single cashpoint up and down the land operate
  just like the ones in the Vatican City. The splendid thing about these papal cash
  dispensers is that the default or principal display language is Latin. Wouldn''t
  you love to go and withdraw your money, if you have any, and be faced with the rigorous
  beauty of that ancient language? Life would somehow become immeasurably less wretched
  were it so.


  CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PLASTIC BAUBLES AND PLASTIC SHEETING

  Certain Aspects Of Plastic Baubles And Plastic Sheeting is one of those out-of-print
  pamphlets by Dobson that has acquired the aura of legend. Not even the most indefatigable
  of Dobsonistas claims ever to have seen a copy, let alone read it, and some authorities
  doubt that it ever existed at all.

  There is, of course, the famous alleged cover of the pamphlet which was included
  in an exhibition held at the Museum At Or Near Ack-On-The-Vug in 1992 to celebrate
  the inauguration of the Cones Hotline, but this is almost certainly a fake.


  John Major''s government had introduced the Cones Hotline a few weeks before the
  show opened, and cones were much in people''s thoughts. Dobson had an abiding interest
  in cones of all kinds, not just those used for traffic control, and we know that
  he drafted some notes on cones made of plastic, though those too are mysteriously
  missing from the archives.

  Is it likely that the pamphleteer would have addressed the topic of plastic baubles
  and plastic sheeting without finding room for plastic cones as well? The enfant
  terrible of Dobson studies, Gaston Pewt, has this to say: "There can be no doubt
  in my mind that Certain Aspects Of Plastic Baubles And Plastic Sheeting only exists
  in the febrile minds of older, wizened Dobson scholars whose brains have been laid
  waste. Long ago they would have downed tonics and invigorators to combat dyspepsia,
  low spirits, nervousness, heartburn, colic pains, wind in the stomach or pains in
  the bowels, headache, drowsiness, kidney and liver complaints, melancholy, delirium
  tremens, and intemperance. Now they cannot get their hands on such potions, they
  pursue hopeless chimeras. I neither know nor care which ancient, slobbering poop-head
  inserted a counterfeit pamphlet cover into the Cones Hotline exhibition. What I
  know is that whoever did so was trying to feed their misplaced vanity, and score
  points over young, up and coming Dobsonistas like myself, even though at that time
  I had yet to publish my ground-breaking reappraisal of the out-of-print pamphleteer''s
  plastic-related works."

  Stirring words indeed, but we should remember that every single copy of Monsieur
  Pewt''s magisterial study, Plastic Dobson, was pulped before it reached the bookshops,
  for reasons which, like the legendary pamphlet itself, like those tonics and invigorators,
  like the wits of the Dobsonist old guard, and like the Cones Hotline, are now forever
  lost, they are swept away, they are swept away and gone.'
