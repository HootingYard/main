  And while we are on the subject of Hoon ...

  Splattered with seagull droppings, the Woman of Twigs stood at the very edge of
  the cliff, her back to the sea. Barefoot, she rocked gently back and forth on her
  impromptu podium. The villagers were gathered about her, wretched and snivelling.
  Some carried pitchforks, or dainty little tin boxes full of bip. They were all ears
  as they waited for the Woman of Twigs to speak. She had blindfolded herself with
  a threadbare bandage, bound her hair into tufts with flaxen yarn and roots, and
  held in her hands a ribbon of bloody silk. Precisely at the moment that the thousandth
  wave of the day crashed against the rocks below, the Woman of Twigs ceased her rocking,
  cast the ribbon to the winds, and, shouting to make herself heard over the screeching
  gulls, began:

  "You asked me to save the village from Doom. I have communed with a variety of weird
  and tiresome shades to seek guidance. You are correct, your village is imperilled.
  There is only one way to rescue it from the coming agony. Three of your number must
  travel many miles distant, to the town of Hoon. There, they must find a churn, possibly
  broken, the churn of Hoon, which has had engraved upon it a rather fetching likeness
  of myself. Do not ask why. Having scoured Hoon for this churn, and found in Hoon
  this churn of Hoon, it must be brought back here, with due haste, and hurled into
  the boiling sea from this very spot on the cliff''s edge. That task complete, your
  village will once again know glee. I have left unmentioned one crucial point. The
  three who will venture to Hoon, there to find and return the Hoon-churn, must all
  be called Ned. That is all."

  Work began at once on building the chariot. In the kitchens, the villagers boiled
  up huge iron pans full of mud and silt dredged from the riverbed. Trees were felled
  in the spinney. The smithy at his anvil beat out a goodly number of nails, spikes,
  and very sharp hooks. Within a week, the foul-smelling but indestructible vehicle
  was ready. Volunteers fanned out across the countryside to trap a suitable beast
  of burden. Horses, oxen, even a crippled reindeer of great elegance, were sighted
  and stalked, but another week elapsed without success. Eventually it was decided
  that the three Neds would have to travel under their own steam, pulling the chariot
  by themselves. Ned, Ned and Ned agreed, drooling with excitement in their eagerness
  to set out on so glorious a journey, one that would save the village and bring them
  renown.

  They left the village at a gallop, in the middle of the night. Without maps, they
  relied entirely on local lore and superstition. From infancy, each Ned had been
  imbued with a long catechism of saws and proverbs. Now, each had engraved upon his
  skull a different couplet, handed down through the generations:

  If you wish to go to Hoon / Spit three times and follow the moon

  Hoon''s beyond yon crumpled hedge / Hemmed around by gorse and sedge

  When you see eight pebbles strewn / You''re eight days and nights from Hoon

  They travelled without pause, two dragging the stinking chariot while the third
  lay bundled in it, sleeping or feeding from a polythene bag full of curdled slops.
  At first they followed the course of the Great Frightening River, until suddenly
  it wormed its way underground. For eighteen months they travelled through a desolate
  landscape, flat, grey, and curiously redolent of shurd. But as they entered Hoon''s
  hinterland, things changed. In rapid succession, they passed an asbestos works,
  a barrel of rainwater, a customs post, damp hectares, elk encampments, fenceposts,
  grotesque wooden carvings, horrifying shrubbery, improbable water tables, jerrybuilt
  huts, a kaolin quarry, lumps of disgust, monstrous gulches, nebulous stretches of
  pointed brambly things, ornithologists'' hideaways, parakeet enclosures, quarantine
  sheds, rusk markets, strange gobbets of sludge, a tremendous farmyard, urn burials,
  a vacuum, wrestling pythons, extravagant banks of yellow fog, yeast traffickers,
  and a zither-crushing factory. Ned said to Ned and Ned, "Soon we shall be in Hoon.
  I can feel it in my water." He was not mistaken.

  The great South Gate of Hoon was over a thousand years old, and completely overgrown
  by clumps of hideous, fleshy foliage oozing poisonous sap. All attempts to destroy
  this abominable vegetation had met with failure, and it had not been possible to
  open the gate for at least two centuries. Rather than blasting a hole in the town
  wall, a ramshackle lift contraption was knocked up close by. Two wooden platforms,
  one either side of the great wall, were raised and lowered by an exciting system
  of pistons, pulleys and winches operated by a team of gate-keepers wearing boa constrictor
  masks. In return for their labours, they exacted a hefty price; unfortunately the
  three Neds were utterly penniless. Muttering among themselves, our heroic trio decided
  to proffer gifts in lieu of payment. Ned offered the gate-keepers his cap, which
  was made of rusted whisks. Ned presented them with a sick toad he had been pampering
  for the past month. Ned gave them a handful of silt scraped from the underside of
  the chariot. Well pleased with these gifts, the gate-keepers allowed the exhausted
  threesome to clamber onto the platform.

  Two days later, the three Neds were lowered to the ground on the other side of the
  wall. At last they were in Hoon! Finding the possibly broken churn of Hoon could
  only be a matter of time. They would be implacable, ferreting into every corner
  of the ancient town. As soon as they disembarked from the wooden platform, however,
  they were set upon by a whirling tangle of ruffians who bashed them senseless, stole
  the shirts off their backs, emptied their polythene bags of slops into the gutter,
  wholly dismantled the chariot, had at them with ferocious scimitars, and left them
  for dead. And indeed, Ned and Ned were dead. Ned was carted off by a passing stretcher
  patrol, but panted his last breath an hour later, by which time the ruffians had
  scampered away, heading for the mountains. They stopped by the kaolin quarry to
  eat their packed lunches, and then, as night came down, they strode up the mountainside,
  these ruffians, their gazes fixed on the sky above, to look at the numberless stars,
  to view the boundless firmament.'
