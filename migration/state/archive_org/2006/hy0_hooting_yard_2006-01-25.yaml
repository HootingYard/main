full_text: 'A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE COWS

  Misfortune can strike a cow out of the blue. To give but one example, the field
  in which it is standing may become flooded after heavy rainfall or, if not flooded
  exactly, then pitted with many, many puddles. No cow likes to stand in water, so
  such a circumstance must be counted a misfortune.

  The cow in the puddle, however, is une jolie vache compared to the cow which inattentively
  wanders onto some railway tracks and then comes to a halt. Continuing across the
  tracks would be the wiser option, for as long as the cow remains where it is, it
  is an imperilled cow. But unlike owls, cows are not noted for wisdom. The imperilled
  cow on the railway tracks may suffer the misfortune of being killed by a runaway
  locomotive without a cow-conscious driver at the helm. I am not sure helm is the
  correct word for the little cabin in which a train driver, cow-conscious or otherwise,
  sits or stands, but let that pass. What we can say with certainty is that a motionless
  cow in the path of a runaway train will suffer the greatest of misfortunes, that
  is, a violent death. By comparison, the previous cow, the one standing in the puddle,
  is almost as happy a cow as the laughing one that mysteriously appears on the wrappers
  of a brand of processed cheese triangles in this country, and perhaps in other countries
  too.

  If my memory serves, that laughing cow is red and white. If a real cow was red and
  white, it too would probably suffer misfortune, for its colouration would make it
  an easy target for predators. Larger, more savage beasts, ones with vision alert
  to bright primary colours, in this case red, would be far more likely to attack
  the laughing cow than a neighbouring cow that was, say, beige or dun or even dappled.
  Such being the case, one wonders why the red and white cow is laughing.

  The fourth in our series of unfortunate cows is the one that is stricken by disease.
  In the popular mind, the most notable cow disease is bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
  or mad cow disease. I, for one, can never read the technical phrase without visualising
  a cow with a brain that has turned to sponge. That may be because I am mispronouncing
  the word spongiform. Either way, I think we can agree that this is the least fortunate
  cow we have encountered so far.

  Next week we will be taking a stroll down a pathway that leads to four more cows
  assailed by misfortune. Until then, your homework is as follows. Answer the following
  questions to the best of your ability, and with a certain dash.

  1. If, through some eldritch soul-transfer conjured by a warlock, you swapped places
  with one of the four unfortunate cows above, which one would it be, and why?

  2. Would you follow the example of the red and white cow, and laugh in the face
  of misfortune, or would you take steps to avert it? If so, how?

  3. What tips would you give to a cow standing in a puddle?

  4. Imagine you are a train driver. Would you be cow-conscious? If so, list six examples
  of your cow-consciousness.


  An unfortunate cow


  THE GNAWED AND THE CHEWED

  Dobson was hopeless at identifying bones which had been gnawed by wild animals,
  but that did not stop him trying. Sometimes, if he tired of leaning on a fence watching
  pigs in a sty, he would go and get his big spade and dig up bones. He had a few
  favourite locations, such as the perimeter fence of the zoo, and the aerodrome,
  and he always came home with a sackful.

  "Look!" he would shout, brandishing one of his finds at Marigold Chew, "If I am
  not mistaken this is the leg bone of a weasel which has been gnawed by a pony!",
  or "Look!" he might say, "I''ll wager this is the tibia of an arctic hare that has
  been gnawed by a squirrel!" He was invariably wrong.

  Dobson mounted his bones on rectangular pieces of hardboard which he then hung on
  the walls of what passed as his study. He added a carefully-written label to each
  one, on which he inscribed the date and location on which he exhumed it, the animal
  he supposed it came from, and the animal whose teeth-marks he purported to see as
  evidence of gnawing. Often these striations were not teeth-marks at all, but Dobson
  was adamant.

  One wet February Friday, Dobson and Marigold Chew received a visit from Vlasto Pismire,
  a man who bore an uncanny resemblance to the meteorite-obsessed Liberal Democrat
  MP Lembit Opik. Pismire supplied cocoa to circuses. Having heard, erroneously, that
  Marigold was a past queen bee of the flying trapeze, he was hoping to sell cocoa
  to her for old time''s sake. Quickly apprised of his mistake, Pismire was about
  to leave when Dobson, in an uncharacteristic fit of generosity, invited him to stay
  for dinner. He stayed not only for dinner but for the next four months, during which
  time he barely stopped talking. It is said of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge that
  he could talk for hours, fluently, entrancingly, with barely a pause, but without
  his interlocutors having the faintest idea what on earth he was going on about.
  Pismire was a man of the same kidney, and Dobson found him fascinating.

  On that first evening, as they sat around the table eating pap and slops, Pismire--having
  been shown Dobson''s collection of labelled bones--said: "I find it interesting
  that your surname, Marigold, is Chew, while in that other room there are all those
  bones which have been gnawed. Are you sure that your name is not Marigold Gnaw,
  and that the bones have been chewed? But of course not. I jest. If my memory serves,
  the OED defines chew as "to crush, bruise, and grind to pulp, by the continued action
  of the molar teeth, with help of the tongue, cheeks, and saliva", and gnaw as "to
  bite (something) persistently so as to injure it or remove portions of it; to wear
  away by a continued biting or nibbling", so whereas one may idly think of chewing
  and gnawing as similar activities, they are in fact radically different. Equally
  worthy of note is the fact that in this house of Chew and the gnawed, the dinner
  you have both so kindly provided requires neither chewing nor gnawing, being a bland
  thin sludge one can gulp down, bowl after bowl, without involving one''s teeth one
  whit. It is the kind of dinner I approve of, for I like to rest my teeth as others
  rest their weary limbs, the better to preserve them. Speaking of which, if I were
  you, Dobson, I would start collecting animals'' teeth as well as bones, so you could
  match up the gnawer with the gnawed."


  Left : Lembit Opik. Right : Vlasto Pismire

  Dobson never followed this advice, but it did inspire the coda to one of his finest
  out-of-print pamphlets, which he began writing on the wet June day later that year
  when the cocoa man finally left the house. The circumstances of his departure were
  curious. Marigold Chew had embarked upon a mural painting of eels, using one of
  the walls of the dining room. Because he seemed to need no sleep, Pismire had barely
  moved from the dinner table throughout his stay, comfortable in his chair and prattling
  away irrespective of an audience. It had occurred to both Dobson and Marigold Chew
  that perhaps he existed in a separate time continuum and that he thought they were
  still having the same meal as when he had arrived in February. The fact that he
  never removed the napkin tucked into his shirt front supported this view.

  "What I find puzzling," said Marigold Chew to Dobson on the morning of that June
  day, as they trudged along the old canal towpath, "Is that when he sat down, the
  walls were bare. Now they are teeming with eels, yet he appears not to notice."

  "Perhaps he is a blind cocoa man," suggested Dobson.

  "Don''t be ridiculous, Dobson," snorted Marigold Chew.

  As they approached the house on their return, they were astonished to find the Lembit
  Opik lookalike hurrying out of the front door.

  "I can no longer remain in a house full of painted eels!" he shouted, looking stricken,
  "For I have long feared eel depictions of all kinds. If ever you invite me to dinner
  again, I will tell you why."

  He carried on talking, but as he scurried away his words were lost on the wild winds.
  Within the hour, Dobson had written the first six pages of his pamphlet Chew, Gnaw,
  Eel, Teeth, Pap And Slops For Dinner : A Memoir Of Vlasto Pismire, the only known
  copy of which is rumoured to be in the possession of the Liberal Democrat MP for
  Montgomeryshire. He keeps it under lock and key and will deny its existence if questioned.


  THE GLOVE OF IB

  Here is an accurate account of a dream I had just before I woke up this morning.

  I was in an unknown seaside resort with a companion, whose identity was hazy. We
  were walking, and passed a couple of men of Mediterranean appearance, gaunt, and
  dressed in very plain, neat brown coats and hats. They had a film noir air. If they
  hadn''t been so thin Peter Lorre would have been a good choice to play one or both
  of them. I turned to my companion, pointed at one of the men, and said "He just
  said ib". The man at whom I had pointed thrust out his hand, clad in a brown (leather?)
  glove and clutched me around the throat. He fixed me with a stare more intense than
  menacing, and withdrew his hand, leaving the glove in place. "That is the Glove
  of Ib," he announced, "Now read this." He handed me a pamphlet, on which was written
  "He has weak Bomba. His Bomba is not good". I understood that this referred to me.
  The words were printed in heavy black block capitals on brown paper and reminded
  me of a Vorticist tract like Wyndham Lewis'' BLAST. The Glove of Ib, around my neck,
  was not uncomfortable, but I wanted to be rid of it. The Peter Lorre figures had
  disappeared--time had passed--and I walked around the seaside resort, alone now,
  trying to find them. Then I woke up.

  What can it all mean? I should point out that I did not wake to find myself being
  strangled, nor had my neck become entangled by a stray dressing-gown cord or length
  of string. One thing of which I am sure is that I must work hard today on strengthening
  my Bomba.


  Lorre & Lewis

  ADDENDUM : Last week I had one of those dreams in which you read or write something
  of breathtaking profundity. Usually, the earth-shattering words are forgotten as
  soon as you awake, and the morning is spent in a state of frustration, trying to
  retrieve what seemed so meaningful. On this occasion, I was lucky enough to recall
  what I had dream-written, and I can thus share my dazzling insight with you. It
  was a poem, and--in its entirety--read as follows:

  We are steam, and we mean what we mean


  STUNNED STARLINGS

  Pockmarked, moustachioed, and bonkers, evil tyrant "Uncle Joe" Starling stepped
  out on to the balcony of his dacha. He sat down in his dacha deckchair and peered
  in his bonkers and evil way at a flock of stalins soaring through the blue sky above
  him. Uncle Joe liked curlews more than he liked stalins, and he had once ordered
  the firing squad for a bird-hating apparatchik who served him curlew soup at a ceremonial
  picnic lunch one summer''s afternoon. But he liked stalins well enough, and his
  lips curled into a smile as the birds vanished behind some trees over by the black
  lake. There were bones at the bottom of the black lake. Not only the bones of small
  animals which had inadvertently fallen into the lake and been eaten by the carnivorous
  fish that swam there, but the bones of the soup maker, whose bullet-riddled corpse
  Uncle Joe had had tossed into the churning black water by his minions.

  The chief dacha minion was Halob, father of Old Halob who became famous as the irascible
  trainer of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. Halob the minion was a wheezy, crumpled
  man, whose tunic was often stained with egg and beetroot, for these were his favourite
  foods, though he had few teeth left in his head. Halob was a perfect minion, for
  within his soul burned an indestructible love for Uncle Joe Starling, a love so
  pure that it had been celebrated in verse by national poet Igor Zoogoo, a verse
  that was proclaimed now at the marriage ceremonies of even the most feckless young
  peasant couples.

  There was a wedding taking place in a village near the dacha later today, and Uncle
  Joe had decided to attend. As he watched the flock of stalins crossing the sky again,
  flying back from whence they came, he twisted the little red pneumatic knob on the
  arm of his dacha deckchair to summon his minion. Halob arrived on the balcony within
  seconds, creaking a little.

  "Your bones creak, Halob," observed Starling, and then he cackled, "Unlike the bones
  of the soup maker which lie rotting at the bottom of the black lake!"

  Halob cackled too. He always cackled when Starling cackled. They cackled together
  often, at least four or five times a day, whenever they recalled the numberless
  victims of Uncle Joe''s firing squads. For they were cruel men, both of them, despite
  the purity of Halob''s love.

  "I have decided to perform a song at the wedding this afternoon," said Uncle Joe,
  "So get me the sheet music, Halob."

  Nodding in acknowledgement, Halob headed back inside the dacha to do as he was bid.
  He did not need to ask which sheet music to fetch for his beloved, for Starling
  only had one song in his repertoire. The song he liked to sing was "The Windmills
  Of Your Mind", made famous by Noel Harrison, son of the actor Rex Harrison. Rex
  had many wives, both real and fictional*, and though it would not be difficult to
  ascertain which of the wives was Noel''s mother, I cannot be bothered to find out.
  I can, however, tell you that Rex and Noel were watching a storm one evening when
  a bolt of lightning utterly obliterated a tree directly in front of them. What sort
  of tree it was, and whether this Act of God was related in any way to the Lord''s
  displeasure at Rex''s performance as the Pope in The Agony And The Ecstasy, are
  both important matters which require further investigation. The Hooting Yard Rex
  Harrison Research Institute is, however, understaffed at present, so unless a volunteer
  sidles up to the entrance flap of the Institute''s somewhat bedraggled tent in the
  near future, we are going to have to put this on hold.

  Now, listen carefully. On the afternoon of that country wedding when Uncle Joe Starling
  startled the feckless young peasants by striding into their reception, and then
  delighted them by singing "The Windmills Of Your Mind", his minion made a tape recording.
  Years later, on his deathbed, Halob entrusted the precious piece of magnetic tape
  to his son Old Halob, who in turn passed it on to fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
  as a gift for coming second in a particularly close-fought five hundred metre sprint
  final. When fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol''s non-fictional belongings were put
  up for auction in an old barn in a field somewhere near where many sinister cows
  were grazing, the tape fell into the hands of the Korean dance band leader Park
  No Lip. He gave it to his daughter, who was at the time emerging as a key figure
  in the boop-boop-boohoocha scene. Her beat combo, the Stunned Starlings, sampled
  Uncle Joe''s vocals on their cover version of Rex Harrison''s son''s worldwide smash
  hit. Sadly, however, their record failed to interest anyone except their close-knit
  pals, and you will search iTunes and other online music download resources in vain.
  Let that be a lesson to you.

  FOUR UNCANNY TALES

  Here are four stories, each of a hundred words. Earlier versions, a little shorter
  or longer, can be dug out from the archives should you care to look.

  I

  I was sitting on a bench in a bower on a bright summer''s day. It was a Wednesday,
  or possibly a Thursday, in August, in the year after the Kennedy assassination,
  far far away in Dallas, and the air was heady with verbena, and hollyhock. I was
  eating my snack. All of a sudden, gruesome suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial
  hideousness began oozing from my marmalade and fish-head sandwich, and I swooned.
  When I came to, I had a tiny radio transmitter implanted in my forehead, but I remained
  unaware of it for the rest of my sordid and sorry life.

  II

  They called him Blomqvist, and he was the village wrestler. He lived in a room above
  the post office. No other living being ever set foot in the room until the day Blomqvist
  died. They found him lying on his bed, as if he were asleep, but there was no doubt
  that he was dead, for hovering above his chest was a baleful phantom, emitting gruesome
  suppurations of foul-smelling extraterrestrial hideousness which it poured into
  a funnel inserted into Blomqvist''s right ear. They closed up the room and nailed
  the door shut. It remained unopened for the next hundred years.

  III

  The bell tower had bells in it, but that was not what caught the attention of Jarvis,
  the bird scientist.

  "Look, there is a bird on the bell tower," he said to his pneumonia-racked assistant
  Cubbit, who was doing something foolish with a pair of bicycle clips.

  Jarvis pointed at the bird, expecting Cubbit to look, but the spindly youth was
  distracted by a passing pantechnicon all a-clatter with pots and pans. It was the
  neighbourhood Windy Man, on his rounds, and spookily, sitting next to him in the
  passenger seat, was a hideous extraterrestrial being, suppurating, greasy and malevolent.

  IV

  "Hand me that chaffinch, Cubbit," said Jarvis to his lantern-jawed assistant. Jarvis
  was a bird scientist, devoted to the study of chaffinches. Wandering the hills,
  he had spotted one. As Cubbit picked up the chaffinch, he heard a scream. Spinning
  round, he saw Jarvis being engulfed by a gruesome suppurating monster. The poor
  lad scampered back to the lab and told what had happened to Mrs Purgative.

  "Well! I never heard of such a thing!" she exclaimed. She hoisted her mop on her
  shoulder, took Cubbit by his withered hand, and led him far away, all the way to
  Gondwanaland.


  NIDOR

  Last week I bumped into an old acquaintance in the street, and almost the first
  thing he said was, "Frank, tell me about nidor". Luckily, I had just been reading
  Blodgett''s Book Of Animal Sacrifice, and was able to spout forth much wisdom on
  the subject. It seems only fair to reprint here the passage which allowed me to
  impress my old pal. Note that the book is available in electronic format from www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/savagerituals/sacrifice/beastsofthefield.html

  There is nothing better to put some zing into an overcast Thursday morning after
  a night of fitful sleep than to wander into the desert and sacrifice a quadruped.
  Goats, I feel, have been a little overdone--excuse the pun--as have rams. Why not
  try a bison, or even a dromedary? Before you can smell the wafting nidor of charred
  animal flesh, however, you will need to set up a sacrificial altar. Stone slabs
  are useful, but if there are none to hand, you can improvise using sticks and branches.
  Don''t build your altar too high--remember you will have to tether your beast to
  it prior to slaughter. Once the altar is satisfactorily completed, I recommend that
  you ritually cleanse it. There are several very effective ritual cleaning agents
  on the market which shouldn''t put too big a dent in your pocket. I usually use
  Dr Gillespie''s Aromatic Camphor & Myrrh Preparation, but then I am very fond of
  the packaging. Some wailing and ululation while you scrub never goes amiss. Now,
  tie your bison, dromedary, or other quadruped to the altar and sprinkle it with
  something--herbs, space-age glitter-dust, talc, anything you like--and slaughter
  it. Making very careful use of your safety matches, ignite the dead beast and do
  a bit more wailing. The air will soon be heavy with nidor, especially if you fan
  the flames with palm leaves. When the fire has utterly consumed your sacrificial
  animal, do tidy up after you. The ashes may be cast unto the winds, or you may prefer
  to use a dustpan and brush to place them in an amphora.
