full_text: "GROTS\nKeats had his elfin grot, and we learned last week that Owen Barfield\
  \ had a foldured grot (see 27th August). There are a number of other grots deserving\
  \ of attention, poetic and otherwise. Gervase Beerpint's \"fuming, hapless grot\"\
  \ springs to mind--at least, to my mind--as an example of a so-called poetic grot\
  \ that we really could have done without. It is the setting for one of his earliest\
  \ poems, included in Crouton As Exemplar, the collection of Beerpint's teenage drivel\
  \ which is mercifully out of print. A more appealing poetic grot is Scrimgeour's\
  \ \"ten-inch-tall toy plastic grot\", the abiding image from his astonishing narrative\
  \ tour de force How I Lost My Bus Pass And Found It Again Last Tuesday, Not Without\
  \ Certain Hazards. For me this is one of the greatest poems of the late 20th century,\
  \ and its annual recitation at the Hooting Yard Festival Of Texts Related To Bus\
  \ Travel never fails to warm the cockles of my heart.\nAs for non-poetic grots,\
  \ who can fail to be excited by Dobson's grot? Aloysius Nestingbird tells us:\n\
  Dobson went on one of his \"walks\", taking with him a copy of Cliff Castles And\
  \ Cave Dwellings Of Europe by Sabine Baring-Gould, which was at the time his favourite\
  \ reading. Upon his return, his brain was awash with it. \"I must leave this building\
  \ and find a grot in which to live out the rest of my days,\" he shouted, and began\
  \ poring over geological maps of the coast. All attempts to divert him from this\
  \ mania were fruitless. He thought he had identified a suitable grot, one which\
  \ was flooded by the violent incoming tide for only a few hours each day, and began\
  \ moving his belongings thither, employing a local peasant who had a pony and trap.\
  \ Only after four trips did this man demand payment from the impoverished pamphleteer,\
  \ who thrust a spare bottle of vinaigrette dressing into his paws and begged him\
  \ to continue. The peasant was understandably enraged, and threw the bottle back\
  \ at Dobson.\nDobson's next ploy was to try to convince the railway authorities\
  \ to build a new terminus within yards of his grot. They laughed in his face. He\
  \ made one attempt to make the journey by bicycle, with a few kitchen utensils stuffed\
  \ into his panniers, but his knees gave out before he was halfway there, and he\
  \ abandoned the idea as hopeless.\nWhat to do? Everything beginning with the letters\
  \ A to J that Dobson owned was stacked in cardboard cartons in the faraway grot,\
  \ subject to the relentless destructive power of the crashing waves which, twice\
  \ a day, engulfed what he still thought of as his future home, for the peasant had\
  \ ignored the instructions to suspend the cartons by chains from several handy stalactites.\
  \ Dobson calculated how much cash he would need to take cab rides from his building\
  \ to his grot, and was appalled. Indefatigable as ever, he decided to publish a\
  \ new series of tracts on popular subjects, deluding himself that he would make\
  \ enough sales to cover the cost of regular taxi fares. Marigold Chew's printing\
  \ press churned out copies of Some Hurried Notes On Tab Hunter and Eight Things\
  \ You Never Knew About Tuesday Weld, those anomalies in the Dobson oeuvre, but to\
  \ no avail. Not a single copy was ever sold.\nThe dream came to an end on a particularly\
  \ wet Tuesday in March. Tucking another bottle of vinaigrette dressing into his\
  \ pocket, Dobson went to parley with the peasant. He bashed on the door of a tumbledown\
  \ hut next to a ditch by the canal, forcing his mouth into a queasy smile. There\
  \ was no answer, nor would there ever be an answer, for unbeknown to Dobson, the\
  \ peasant had fallen victim to ergot poisoning, gone crackers, and run amok in the\
  \ purple hills. The pamphleteer trudged home, sat with his head in his hands, drank\
  \ fourteen mugs of tea, abandoned all thought of living in his grot, and set to\
  \ work on his matchless essay Why I Do Not Live In A Grot, Elfin Or Otherwise. It\
  \ was to prove a turning point in his career.\nSource : Forgotten Corners Of Dobsoniana\
  \ by Aloysius Nestingbird\n\nCHAPS OOZING CHARM\nFurther archival witterings, again\
  \ from long ago in 2004. This was said to come from a collection called The Vitamin\
  \ B Pirate Gang & Other Maritime Doggerel by Gervase Beerpint, presumably some relation\
  \ to your favourite poet and mine, Dennis Beerpint.\nChaps oozing charm wedged in\
  \ a chest.\n  There's no knowing who'll come out best.\n  One is called Billy, head\
  \ made of cork,\n  Shoulders cast iron, arms and legs chalk.\n  Mythology enwraps\
  \ him like a shroud.\n  His voice is grating and horribly loud.\n  And then there\
  \ is Cedric, aquatic, with fins.\n  He likes to muck about with a box of pins.\n\
  \  He has no ears but his feet are huge.\n  His entire head is covered in rouge.\n\
  \  Hummingbirds pain him, as do owls.\n  He's always had trouble pronouncing vowels.\n\
  \  The third of our trio is Swivel-Eyed Dan.\n  His head is the shape of a frying\
  \ pan.\n  He once went south, looking for bees,\n  But all his dreams blew away\
  \ on a breeze.\n  You have to give credit where it's due -\n  But not to Dan when\
  \ he's dribbling goo.\n  Three of them, then, wedged in a chest,\n  Each one wearing\
  \ a red satin vest,\n  Oozing insouciance, polish, and charm.\n  Let us hope they\
  \ come to no harm.\n  But the chest has been stowed in the hold of a ship\n  Whose\
  \ captain is moody and curls his lip.\n  As they sail out from port, the captain\
  \ growls:\n  \"Damn the beakers! Damm the owls!\n  Damn the crackers! Damn the flaps!\n\
  \  Damn the chest of charming chaps!\"\n  Two hours later, the ship just sank,\n\
  \  And all that remained was a single plank.\n  It floated for weeks and was then\
  \ washed ashore.\n  I found it on the beach and used it for a door.\n  So when you\
  \ come to my stinking hut,\n  Bringing some food for my stinking mutt,\n  Go careful\
  \ by the door and remember your prayers:\n  \"Get wedged in a chest, he who dares\"\
  .\n\nREVELATIONS REGARDING OLD HALOB\nIntensive and scrupulous new biographical\
  \ research on Old Halob, the crusty and cantankerous sporting legend who was for\
  \ many years the coach and mentor of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol, has revealed\
  \ an amazing fact. (I think that sentence really ought to have an exclamation mark\
  \ at the end, to emphasise just how exciting it is.)\nAccording to a recently published\
  \ monograph by Pierre Sugum*, Old Halob worked with fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol\
  \ for forty years without ever suspecting that his protege was not actually real.\
  \ The wizened and untidy trainer, with his moth-eaten clothing and offensive hair\
  \ oil, seems to have overlooked the weekly comic magazine Fictional Athlete Bobnit\
  \ Tivol's Weekly Comic Magazine For Girls And Boys, wherein the sprinter and sometime\
  \ polevaulter's breathtaking athletic feats were chronicled by a series of pseudonymous\
  \ writers and illustrators.\nProfessor Sugum has also unearthed compelling evidence\
  \ that one of these pseudonymous writers may have been Dobson. If this is so, it\
  \ would have been one of the few paying jobs the out of print pamphleteer ever held,\
  \ along with his hectic janitorial escapades in that tinned milk of magnesia factory\
  \ in Winnipeg. Sugum is reluctant to say for certain that Dobson wrote the early\
  \ stories Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol And The Polevaulting Pole That Snapped\
  \ In Two and Fictional Athlete Bobnit Tivol Buffs His Latest Medal With A Frayed\
  \ Rag, leaving it to readers to judge the merits of the case.\nIt is Old Halob's\
  \ ignorance of the athlete's fictional status which is the most astounding revelation\
  \ of the article. One has always been tempted to conclude that the wily coach knew\
  \ more than he let on, and yet this view is comprehensively demolished by Sugum\
  \ in a couple of sentences.\nI wish I could include extracts from this ground-breaking\
  \ essay here, but I have been informed that Professor Sugum is highly litigious,\
  \ a monster of depravity, and wallows in a foul pit of moral turpitude, so it would\
  \ be foolhardy to antagonise him. Instead, here is a snapshot of Old Halob when\
  \ young, or at least a snapshot that purports to be of Old Halob when young, or\
  \ a member of his immediate family, or so I'm told, at any rate, credulous poltroon\
  \ that I am.\n\n*NOTE : \"I Know All There Is To Know About Old Halob Even Though\
  \ I Am A Monster Of Depravity\" in The Bulletin Of Fictional Sprinting And Related\
  \ Athletic Pursuits, Vol XVII, No. 12\n\nDARK STAR CRASHES\nPouring its light into\
  \ ashes. Reason tatters. These are weighty matters. So weighty, indeed, that you\
  \ must note them in your jotter. But--horror of horrors!--with what will you jot?\
  \ You recall with a pang that your biro is lost, or perhaps has been purloined by\
  \ the Biro Thief, he whose exploits have so enthralled the readers of the Daily\
  \ Clang. Your drawer, of course, is innocent of pencils. It has been so since childhood.\
  \ Your papa would have no pencils in his house, you recall, and yet he never revealed\
  \ the wellspring of his loathing. Once, you tried to write about it--with your biro--and\
  \ your book His Loathing: Its Wellspring was, well ... well-received up to a point,\
  \ though there were those who said it lacked a certain dash. To your shame, you\
  \ blamed your papa's chlamydia, a conclusion so preposterous that your uncle sued\
  \ you in a court of law. Behind the door of the court of law lurked a lactose-intolerant\
  \ nitroglycerine boffin, a bluestocking who became your wife and changed your life.\
  \ You pulped all copies of your book and sat in steam. You had a hideous headache\
  \ for a week. But planning, as you did, to raise no storms, you kept all pencils\
  \ from your house, just as your father did. Your wife asked why--you used a nib\
  \ to jot down your reply. I am my father's son, you wrote, He died a pauper. He\
  \ was that kind of guy.\n\nMEDICAL NOTES ON A MEZZOTINTIST\n\"My lung has just collapsed\"\
  \ is not a statement you are likely to hear spoken, for the simple reason that when\
  \ someone's lung has collapsed, they will not be able to do much more than gasp\
  \ for breath. Think of the lung like an airbag which, when punctured, shrivels up\
  \ with a wheezy noise. This is pretty much common sense and does not require extensive\
  \ medical knowledge.\nNow, imagine for a moment that you do have extensive medical\
  \ knowledge, that you are, for present purposes, a senior medico in an important\
  \ hospital. You are sitting at your big desk in your big office, leafing through\
  \ a sheaf of complicated diagrams which would mean nothing to a lay person. Years\
  \ of training, and an acute and piercing mind, allow you to interpret the mass of\
  \ medical information contained in these colourful charts and to reach swift, startling,\
  \ and expert conclusions. You are about to press a blue knob on the desk console\
  \ which pipes your instructions to less expert doctors elsewhere in the hospital,\
  \ when you are interrupted.\nA man enters your office unannounced. He is blubbery\
  \ and shaggy-haired and his clothing is creased and crumpled and he has a woebegone\
  \ yet desperate air and his face is the colour of tallow and he smells of disinfectant\
  \ and he says \"Doctor, doctor, my lung has just collapsed\".\nYou look up at him,\
  \ into his watery eyes, and you press the green knob on your console instead of\
  \ the blue one, and as soon as you hear the gentle hum that indicates you are connected\
  \ to the system, you say \"Please come and get my brother and take him home\". There\
  \ is no exasperation in your voice, just inhuman patience and a trace, perhaps,\
  \ of a love that is fathomless and bold. For you are Doctor Tint, and your visitor\
  \ is Rex Tint. He is known to the world as a supremely talented mezzotintist. To\
  \ you, he is a hypochondriac, constantly assailed by phantom maladies and imagined\
  \ injuries.\nHe is taken home by paramedics and tucked into bed on the mezzanine\
  \ floor of his mezzotint-strewn flat, where he falls asleep. When he awakes, there\
  \ is a chance that he may set to work on his latest mezzotint. Equally, he may be\
  \ convinced that he is subject to black bile and the flux and hare at high speed\
  \ back to the hospital, or to a clinic, or to a soothsayer.\nRex Tint has much in\
  \ common with the current Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, who likes to drink Lemsip\
  \ while he works, because it makes him imagine that he is slightly ill. \"I read\
  \ in a biography of A E Housman that he wrote most of A Shropshire Lad while he\
  \ had a cold,\" he told the BBC, \"And I thought, yes, I know about that--that sort\
  \ of slightly introverted self-pitying mood that a mild illness can give. It is\
  \ absolutely conducive to poems.\"\nRex Tint, however, felt that when mezzotinting,\
  \ he needed something more than a \"mild illness\". He needed to be in trauma, close\
  \ to death, face to face with extinction. Whether this genuinely improved the quality\
  \ of his work is hard to say, for so matchless a mezzotintist was he that an open-mouthed\
  \ gape of awe was--and remains--the only fitting reaction.\nSomewhere between Andrew\
  \ Motion's \"self-pitying mood\" and the mezzotintist Rex Tint's counterfeit death\
  \ agony comes Dobson's approach to creativity. He had read about the Vatican's practice\
  \ of ensuring that the Pope is dead by hitting him on the head three times with\
  \ a special ceremonial hammer while shouting his name in his ear. If the pontiff\
  \ fails to respond, he is pronounced dead, and cardinals are summoned from around\
  \ the world to choose a successor. Dobson was fascinated by this, and whenever he\
  \ felt a pamphlet coming on, he asked Marigold Chew to beat him thrice on the head\
  \ with a hammer and shout \"Dobson! Dobson! Dobson!\". Nursing a throbbing skull,\
  \ he would sit down at his escritoire and set to work.\nI have not yet decided which\
  \ of these three methods would suit me best, so I have decided to nurture a slight\
  \ head cold, feign a collapsed lung, and get bashed on the head with a hammer all\
  \ at the same time, with a dose of bird flu thrown in for good measure. As the reader,\
  \ you will be able to judge the success or otherwise of this courageous plan.\n\n\
  PINDAR WIDGERY, THE PINT-SIZED PROVOCATEUR\nFirst instance. You are walking along\
  \ a country lane as dusk descends. The path is muddy, but you are wearing a pair\
  \ of stout Canadian Forestry Service boots. Crows caw from the trees, and from the\
  \ direction of the lake you hear the demented cry of loons. Jauntily, you swing\
  \ your stick through the air and whistle a half-remembered tune from the golden\
  \ age of the hoochie-coochie dance band era. All of a sudden, your path is blocked\
  \ by a diminutive figure. He is wearing a thrum nightcap and an ill-fitting suit\
  \ of clothes. He has a goatee beard, a pasty complexion, and while one of his eyes\
  \ is mischievously a-twinkle, the other seems dead, as if it were made of glass.\
  \ He is carrying a little drum, and as he stands in front of you, he begins to pound\
  \ it with his strangely muscular fist, arhythmically, even peskily. You step to\
  \ one side, to stride past him, but he dodges in front of you. You step to the other\
  \ side, but he springs sideways to forestall you, all the while banging his drum.\
  \ Your temper rises. Brandishing your stick, you are about to belabour him about\
  \ the head, but he anticipates your move, emits a sinister gurgling noise, and flits\
  \ off into the trees as suddenly as he appeared. You walk on, no longer jaunty,\
  \ but fractious and grim.\nSecond instance. The arena is packed, and you stand at\
  \ your lectern, looking out at the thousands of devotees who have gathered to hear\
  \ your lecture. You enjoy nothing more than demolishing David Icke's theory of intergalactic\
  \ lizard people, and the talk you have prepared for tonight is perhaps your most\
  \ cogent one to date. You clear your throat, and the huge crowd rustles into silence.\
  \ All of a sudden, a diminutive figure crashes on to the stage at your side. He\
  \ is wearing a thrum nightcap and an ill-fitting suit of clothes. He has a goatee\
  \ beard, a pasty complexion, and while one of his eyes is mischievously a-twinkle,\
  \ the other seems dead, as if it were made of glass. He snatches your lecture notes\
  \ from the lectern, rips them into a thousand pieces, and casts them on the floor\
  \ at your feet. Momentarily discombobulated, you become apoplectic with rage, and\
  \ lurch towards the tiny man, intending to wring his neck. But before you can reach\
  \ him, he flits away, and is instantly lost in the crowd. You had felt in such high\
  \ spirits, and now you are fractious and grim.\nThese two instances are fictional,\
  \ of course, for you, the reader, have never been provoked in such a brazen manner\
  \ by so diminutive a fellow in a thrum nightcap. My purpose in inventing these scenes\
  \ was to give you an idea of what it was like to be accosted by Pindar Widgery,\
  \ the pint-sized provocateur. Countless are those who have been so accosted. Each\
  \ tells a similar story, that their mood was good, they were jaunty, in high spirits,\
  \ when this tiny, goateed man in an ill-fitting suit, with that incongruous thrum\
  \ nightcap atop his tiny head, appeared out of nowhere and provoked them to violence,\
  \ violence he escaped by vanishing into a forest, or into a crowd, or even, according\
  \ to some accounts, just going pfffft! in a puff of inexplicable vapour.\nInexplicable\
  \ indeed is the vapour into which he has now disappeared, for the last time. I am\
  \ here to write his obituary. I know that, by convention, I ought to have begun\
  \ by writing \"Pindar Widgery, who has died aged ninety-two in a bobsleigh accident,\
  \ was known as the pint-sized provocateur\". That would have been the correct way\
  \ to begin, but I wanted to break the news gently. And, in truth, I wanted to fill\
  \ my allotted space with something, and, good grief, we know so little about Pindar\
  \ Widgery's life. Ancestry--unknown. Year of birth--unknown. Childhood--a mystery,\
  \ save for an unreliable anecdote buried in a footnote in a biography of silver\
  \ screen siren Edna Purviance. Formative influences--unknown. And so it goes on.\
  \ We do not know when he decided to devote his life to pointless provocations, nor\
  \ why. We can only guess that a smile crossed his lips when he was described in\
  \ print as \"the most exasperating man on the planet\". We do not even know if that\
  \ dead eye was made of glass. Perhaps all we can be sure of was that his presence,\
  \ at such an advanced age, on a fully-crewed bobsleigh careering at terrifying speed\
  \ in the snow-capped mountains of a cold and distant winter sports resort, must\
  \ have been yet another provocative act.\nOh, one other thing we know. Many witnesses\
  \ have placed him indisputably on the sixth floor of the Texas Schoolbook Depository\
  \ on Dealey Plaza in Dallas at noon on the 22nd of November 1962. I know this was\
  \ exactly a year before the assassination of John F Kennedy, but still...\nDETOURS\

  \ Glossary\n\n\"IT IS A LITTLE CURIOUS, CONSIDERING THE...\"\n\"It is a little curious,\
  \ considering the devotion of latter-day men of letters to tobacco, that in their\
  \ early days so many of the men who wrote on the subject attacked the social use\
  \ of tobacco with violence and virulence. Their titles are characteristic of their\
  \ style. A writer named Deacon published in 1616 a quarto entitled 'Tobacco tortured\
  \ in the filthy Fumes of Tobacco refined'; but Joshua Sylvester had easily surpassed\
  \ this when he wrote his 'Tobacco Battered and the Pipes Shattered about their Eares,\
  \ that idely Idolize so base and barbarous a Weed, or at least overlove so loathsome\
  \ a Vanity, by a Volley of Holy Shot Thundered from Mount Helicon', 1615. Controversialists\
  \ of that period rejoiced in full-worded titles and in full-blooded praise or abuse.\"\

  \ comparatively few drunkards, gamblers, adulterers, fornicators, murderers, and\
  \ suicides. It is they who excite man's animal senses, by conjuring up alluring\
  \ pictures of drink, and gold, and sexual happiness. By the aid of the higher type\
  \ of spirit brains I have been enabled to perceive the atmosphere surrounding drinking-dens\
  \ and brothels full of all kinds of bestial influences, from elementals, who allure\
  \ men by presenting to their minds all kinds of attractive tableaux, to the earth-bound\
  \ spirits of drunkards and libertines, transformed into horrors of the sub-human,\
