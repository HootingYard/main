full_text: 'A THIRD EPISODE OF BLODGETT ISLAND

  Normal Hooting Yard service will be resumed in the very near future. Meanwhile,
  here is another episode of the exciting series Blodgett And His Pals Hanging Around
  On A Mysterious Island After Surviving A Plane Crash.

  Flashback. A car drives up to a motel in the middle of nowhere. It is not as spooky-looking
  as the Bates Motel, but will something spooky occur? A woman seen from behind opens
  the boot of the car. It is full of lots of different number plates. She goes into
  her motel room and gets undressed for a shower. We still cannot see her face. In
  the shower, we see blonde dye running out of her hair. Aha! It''s Marigold Chew.Next
  we see her going into a post office to collect a letter that''s waiting for her.
  She reads it and begins to weep.

  Now, Marigold Chew is sitting on the beach holding a toy aeroplane. Pabstus Tack
  joins her, strumming his guitar. He thinks that his band''s record sales will increase
  because the world thinks he''s dead. "When the helicopters come to rescue us, we''ll
  be ridiculously and eternally famous!"

  Blasphemous Ted Cargpan is a science teacher who understands meteorology. He explains
  that the raft cannot be launched because the monsoon season is about to descend
  upon them and the raft will be forced in the wrong direction. The last possible
  day to leave was yesterday. Old Halob says they will take a chance and leave tomorrow.
  Marigold Chew says she wants to go on the raft.

  (During the advert break there is a warning about a new film that contains "emotional
  intensity". Would that it were so.)

  Old Halob says there are no spare places on the raft. Marigold Chew says she can
  sail and that fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol knows nothing about maritime matters.

  Flashback. Marigold Chew is walking through a hospital corridor carrying a bouquet
  of flowers. She is heading for room 208. There is a police officer sitting outside
  one of the rooms and she passes him nervously. One of the hospital doctors is getting
  into his car in the garage. His name is Doctor Fang. Marigold Chew is sitting in
  his car. She tells Doctor Fang she has come to see her mother who is dying of cancer,
  and she needs Doctor Fang''s help.

  The Grunty Man is fishing. Tiny Enid says "Please talk to me". "I am going on the
  raft," grunts The Grunty Man.

  Lothar Preen and Dobson are trudging through the forest. They meet up with Blodgett
  and go to the hatch.

  Dobson : "What is this thing?"

  Blodgett : "Exactly. It''s time we talked about this."

  The Grunty Man is packing salted fish on to the raft. Old Halob asks fictional athlete
  Bobnit Tivol if he has any knowledge of maritime matters. "Are you voting me off?"
  shouts fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. He heads off angrily to see Marigold Chew.
  He tells her he knows she is a fugitive from justice. "Your secret''s safe with
  me but you''re not getting my spot on the raft!"

  Marigold Chew : "If I want your spot I''ll get it"

  Dennis Beerpint asks Old Halob if they will come back for everyone else once they
  are rescued. Old Halob says it might be hard to find the island again. Then he seizes
  up with stomach cramps. Dennis Beerpint runs off to find Dobson.

  Blodgett says he has known about the hatch for three weeks. Dobson wonders how they
  can open it. Lothar Preen thinks it might be dangerous to open it. "Maybe it was
  never meant to be opened... from outside!" he says, dramatically. Marigold Chew
  runs up to say there is something wrong with Old Halob. He is writhing on the ground.
  Dobson tends to him. Dennis Beerpint looks stricken.

  Flashback. Marigold Chew with Doctor Fang. It''s the middle of the night and they
  have three hours to kill. "Do you think it''s still there?" says Marigold Chew.
  In the middle of nowhere, under a big tree, they take spades out of the boot of
  a car and start digging. There may be goats in the distance.

  Blodgett and Dobson are talking about Old Halob. Dobson thinks there is something
  in his water. Old Halob says he feels better if he neither moves nor breathes. It
  seems someone has deliberately poisoned him. Blodgett says he had no idea Marigold
  Chew was a fugitive from justice. Much talk of who knows what and the use of discretion
  in the sharing of knowledge.

  Pabstus Tack is playing his guitar to Minnie Crunlop''s baby. He is happy to be
  writing songs again. He suggests Minnie Crunlop should come and hang out wth him
  after they''re rescued. I think his new song is called "Monster Eats The Pilot".
  Possibly.

  Dobson asks Marigold Chew if she poisoned Old Halob.

  Marigold Chew : "Do you think I''m capable of that?"

  Dobson : "I don''t know what you''re capable of."

  Flashback. Still digging. Marigold Chew''s spade goes clunk. She disinters a small
  box full of her and Doctor Fang''s memorabilia. They sit in the car looking through
  it and listening to an old cassette recording, on which Doctor Fang says: "In twenty
  years we''ll be married" to which Marigold Chew''s reply is "As soon as I can drive
  I''ll just run away". They look at each other. Marigold Chew sobs. They kiss.

  Blodgett and Dennis Beerpint. Blodgett is improvising a poultice for his leg, as
  he tends to do. Dennis Beerpint says he didn''t poison Old Halob. Blodgett says
  he knows Dennis Beerpint is innocent, even if he did burn the raft first time round.
  Dennis Beerpint gets a weird look in his eyes and suddenly says "Don''t open that
  thing! Don''t open that thing!" He is not referring to the poultice, we surmise.

  Old Halob tells fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol he can''t come on the raft because
  he''s a liar and a criminal and he tried to poison him. So fictional athlete Bobnit
  Tivol goes to Marigold Chew and manhandles her and tips her bag open, shaking the
  contents on to the beach in front of the assembled throng.. He picks up a passport
  Marigold Chew has stolen from a woman who drowned. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol
  says Marigold Chew cares about no one and nothing except herself.

  Flashback. At the hospital, Marigold Chew is with her dying mother, holding her
  hand and sobbing. Trembling lower lip. There ought to have been a warning about
  "emotional intensity". Marigold Chew''s mother looks at her and then starts croaking
  "Help! Help!" to the hospital staff. Marigold Chew runs away. A policeman tries
  to stop her but she knocks him out. She runs to Doctor Fang''s car and they screech
  away, but there are sirens and their path is blocked by a police car. She yells
  at Doctor Fang to get out of the car, but he won''t, so she puts her foot down ready
  to ram her way to freedom. Oops. There are gunshots and she doesn''t get very far
  before crashing. Doctor Fang dies in the crash, with the toy aeroplane from the
  memorabilia box on his lap. Uninjured, Marigold Chew runs away.

  On the beach, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol asks Marigold Chew why she wants to
  run away by usurping his place on the raft. Marigold Chew admits that she is a fugitive
  from justice but insists that she didn''t poison Old Halob. Mrs Gubbins wanders
  past looking sulky. Everyone looks at Marigold Chew judgmentally and walks away
  from her, leaving her holding the toy aeroplane.

  Tiny Enid and Dobson watch the finishing touches being put to the raft. Dobson says
  he knows that Tiny Enid was trying to poison The Grunty Man to stop him going, but
  the water bottles got mixed up. Tiny Enid says she only wanted to make him ill enough
  so he wouldn''t be able to leave. Dobson says he won''t tell anybody.

  Marigold Chew and fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol exchange meaningful looks over
  the bonfire. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol tells her he''s back on the crew of
  the raft despite knowing nothing of maritime matters.

  Dennis Beerpint tells Old Halob he set fire to the first raft because he didn''t
  want to leave.

  Tiny Enid tells Marigold Chew that Dobson knows about the poison plot, but not that
  the whole thing was actually Marigold Chew''s idea. Ah, such narrative complexity!


  THE EVIL BAKERY

  "Eek! Eek!" trilled the twins, as they turned a corner by the market square and
  saw, looming above them, the big dark walls of the evil bakery. It was a sinister,
  if familiar, sight. Instinctively, the twins clutched each other''s hands, as from
  behind the iron gates they heard what they knew was the bellowing of the Hairy Man.
  They hoped they would be able to pass by without him seeing them, but they suspected
  that, as ever, the Hairy Man would be peering out at the street through his powerful
  binoculars, and they were right. As they tried to flit past, wishing themselves
  invisible, the Hairy Man thrust one of his massive hairy paws through the railings
  and beckoned them. He stopped bellowing for a moment. The twins'' legs had turned
  to jelly. Clouds scudded across the sky. Across the way, a French Impressionist
  painter captured the scene with swift, sure brushstrokes. The twins, the Hairy Man,
  even the vast gloomy bakery itself, are all a blur, just as they are in my memory.

  It is hard to believe that fifty years have passed since this scene took place.
  I should be telling you about tin, tin and zinc and titanium, but I am ever drawn
  back to the evil bakery, and the twins and the Hairy Man with his binoculars. What
  did he say to them, when, terrified, they responded to his beckoning paw as if drawn
  by magnetism? Is it true that he merely gave them each a pastry and sent them on
  their way? That later, as they sat outside the Owl Library, they chuckled as the
  fruit filling of the pastries dribbled down their chins? What exactly did Under-Sheriff
  Coggery mean when he testified, later, that the very air of the town that day had
  a tang of rare Oriental spices, and of diesel fumes? I am standing on the bridge
  now, and hailstones are pinging off my hat, and still the mystery remains.

  The Hairy Man lies buried in the churchyard, the twins of course are entombed in
  some giant foreign cathedral, and the evil bakery itself is no more. It was torn
  down after the events of that day, in riots, and on the site there now stands a
  teenage milk bar wherein scruffy youngsters strum guitars and sing inane songlets,
  oblivious of the evil spirits flying round and round, invisible.


  BLODGETT ISLAND : THE ADVENTURE CONTINUES

  Flashback. Dennis Beerpint is looking out of a hotel window. He has a row with Old
  Halob about watching television at 5.32 in the morning. Dennis Beerpint runs off
  down the hotel corridor yelling that Old Halob is not his father.

  On the beach, approaching dawn. Dennis Beerpint and Old Halob are happily together
  now. Dennis Beerpint walks over to a tree to do a wee and sees the mad Tantarabim
  woman, armed with a rifle, stalking around the camp. She sees him. He wakes Old
  Halob. Everyone else wakes up, excitedly. Lothar Preen tells everyone to calm down.
  The mad Tantarabim woman announces "The Others are coming!"

  She explains that sixteen years ago her ship ran aground on the island. There were
  six of them in all. She was seven months pregnant and delivered the baby all by
  herself. On the same day they saw a pillar of black smoke in the forest. That night
  the Others came and took her baby away. "Now they are coming again, for all of you.
  You have three choices. You can run, you can hide, or you can die."

  Dobson wants to stick with what is tangible, which means the raft. They have to
  build rails on the beach to launch it. Everyone helps begin pushing it into the
  water, to the accompaniment of stirring music. But there is a mishap which Old Halob
  seems to blame on fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol. Then they see a huge plume of
  black smoke rising in the forest, just like the mad Tantarabim woman said.

  Lothar Preen asks the mad Tantarabim woman how many of ''them'' there were. She
  says: "I told you all I know. I can vanish into the jungle. But there are forty
  of you."

  Dobson, Blodgett and Joost Van Dongelbraacke take the mad Tantarabim woman to the
  hatch. Lothar Preen points out, not unreasonably, that the hatch might belong to
  the Others. They still don''t know how to open it. The mad Tantarabim woman points
  out that she has a stash of dynamite at Blister Lane Bypass, but they will have
  to collect it before nightfall.

  Flashback. Dobson is sitting in the airport bar. A woman we have never seen before
  joins him and starts chatting him up. Then she takes a call on her phone and walks
  off, promising to continue their chat on the plane. They exchange seat numbers.

  Dobson tells everyone that they have a plan but they have to head off into the forest
  to get supplies. He tells them to get the raft into the water and then to go and
  hide in the caves. Blasphemous Ted Cargpan says that the dynamite will be volatile
  so he had better join the group to make sure they don''t get blown up.

  Flashback. Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol is under arrest after having a fight with
  an important municipal official. The detective says he knows fictional athlete Bobnit
  Tivol''s real identity and that he is a conman who preys on the sick and the needy.
  "You''re being deported," he says.

  Fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol is chopping bamboo for the raft. Dobson gives him
  a revolver. "You''re the only one going on the raft who knows how to use one." Fictional
  athlete Bobnit Tivol tells Dobson that about a week before the flight he met Dobson''s
  father in a bar, and how Dobson''s father said he wanted to say sorry to Dobson.
  Hearing this news, Dobson begins sobbing.

  Flashback. At the airport, the marshal who has Marigold Chew under arrest is checking
  in a case with five guns in it. The airline person wants to know why he needs so
  many firearms. The marshal tells the story of how he has been chasing after Marigold
  Chew for three years, and how she has been taunting him, but he knew how desperate
  she was to get her hands on Doctor Fang''s toy aeroplane. Marigold Chew attacks
  the marshal, and as she is restrained, he says "That''s why I need five guns".

  Marigold Chew says she wants to join the dynamite-gathering gang. The plume of smoke
  is ominously visible in the background.

  Pabstus Tack is wandering around getting people to put messages in a bottle. The
  dynamite gang say farewell to the raft crew. Then they head off into the forest,
  following the mad Tantarabim woman. Blodgett asks her where she got those scratches.
  "A bush". Blodgett thinks it must have been a ferocious bush. "We must keep going!"
  she says.

  Blasphemous Ted Cargpan is cantankerous. They enter the Dark Territory. The Blister
  Lane Bypass is not far now. Sixteen years ago someone lost an arm here. "We must
  move quickly!" Blasphemous Ted Cargpan decides he doesn''t want to lose his arm
  and is going back to the beach.

  Back at the raft, fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol brings the perfectly-hewn bamboo
  mast he''s been working on.

  The dynamite gang are trudging through the rain. There are strange noises, barking
  or howling. Blasphemous Ted Cargpan reappears, panicking, shouting "Run! Run!" Crashing
  and deep booming noises. They hide in some foliage and there is sudden silence.
  The mad Tantarabim woman explains. "It''s a security system to protect the island."

  Dennis Beerpint asks Mrs Gubbins why she''s folding clothes. "Because I''m anal,"
  she replies. Dennis Beerpint gives his dog to Mrs Gubbins, explaining that the dog
  is a good listener and she can talk to it about Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp.

  Flashback. Mrs Gubbins is at the airport. Lothar Preen asks if she can watch his
  bag for a minute. Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp arrives and he and Mrs Gubbins start
  arguing. Mrs Gubbins reports Lothar Preen to the security people.

  Lothar Preen gives the raft crew some electrical and other equipment he has salvaged,
  including a single flare. He''s that kind of guy.

  The dynamite gang arrives at Blister Lane Bypass. They look at a huge ruined old
  sailing ship looming there mysteriously.

  Flashback. Tiny Enid and The Grunty Man at the airport. Tiny Enid spills coffee
  all over The Grunty Man. A bitchy couple nearby talk about them, not realising that
  Tiny Enid understands every word.

  Tiny Enid and The Grunty Man are on the beach. She gives him a list of useful nautical
  words she has written down for him. He sobs and says he''s sorry. She sobs too.
  They hug and sob and apologise to each other and kiss.

  Pabstus Tack is still filling a bottle with messages. There is a silent scene of
  meaningful looks and hand-holding and farewells and general bonding. The raft is
  launched. The dog swims out to follow it, but Dennis Beerpint tells it to go back,
  and it does. On the raft are Old Halob, Dennis Beerpint, The Grunty Man and fictional
  athlete Bobnit Tivol. There is stirring music as those on the beach look meaningfully
  at the raft sailing away into the blue vastness. And behind them, the plume of black
  smoke rises still...


  WHAT TO DO ON A WINTER''S DAY IN TANTARABIM

  This handy guide has been produced by the Tantarabim Tourist Board, a body riddled
  with corruption from top to toe, although its internal politics need not concern
  the innocent reader who merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the bailiwick
  of Tantarabim on a cold and blustery winter''s day, swaddled in woollen garments
  against the elements. Let''s start again. This is a handy guide to the sort of activities
  you and your family can enjoy in Tantarabim during the winter months, should you
  be unlucky enough to have your plane make a forced landing there due to storminess,
  surely the only reason to go anywhere near Tantarabim in the first place, given
  how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist who does not mind discomfort
  and privations, Tantarabim can be a source of much entertainment and interest, if
  the words are used loosely. So put on your hat and come with me now as we creep
  past the gore-splattered beasts with venomous fangs which guard all approaches to
  the town, and I shall list at least five things you can do when stuck in Tantarabim
  during a blizzard.

  1. Plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden chutes which deliver you into
  a flaming pit.

  2. Be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven-hoofed imps spitting sulphur. You will
  have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won''t succeed!

  3. Take a guided tour of the choc ice factory. The price of entry includes the opportunity
  to taste their wares.

  4. Become embroiled in a fight to the death with Bonecrusher Jim, an untamed python
  which has been deprived of food for months.

  5. Spend a night in one of Tantarabim''s many inns, where you will be entranced
  by the primitive gaslight, inexplicable night-time banging and crashing noises,
  swarms of phantom locusts, and walls and ceilings that seem to move when you are
  not looking. Most inns do not charge for children under sixteen, probably because
  they are likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into the
  sea.


  TEN YEARS AGO TOO

  Another item that appeared on Hooting Yard ten years ago today was this:

  Colossal, crude, terrible and sublime, Brann opened the ears of the people by the
  mighty power of his untamed language, by the smashing fury of his wrath of words...
  Waste, futile and planless, mere howling, empty, chaotic waste, for no purpose under
  heaven but to serve as food for idle fancies as to what might have been--such to
  me is the death of Brann, and my throat chokes with sorrow and my soul is sick with
  vain despair.

  That is a quotation from Milo Hastings'' preface to Brann The Iconoclast, a collection
  of pieces by William Cowper Brann (1855--1898). You can read the whole thing here,
  or you might prefer, as I do, to repair to a deserted windswept promontory and shout
  those colossal, crude, terrible and sublime words at the sky, and watch birds drop
  down dead.
