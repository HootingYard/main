full_text: 'BONKERS ALIBIS

  If you are suspected of having committed a crime, and are placed under arrest by
  law enforcement officers, never provide an alibi which is bonkers. This advice holds
  true whether you are innocent or guilty, or even in that grey area between the two,
  like a Kafka character.

  Let us assume, for the purposes of our argument, that you were indeed the shady,
  limping figure eye-witnesses recalled seeing emerging from the pastry shop clutching
  a handful of banknotes fresh from the opened till over which is now slumped the
  grievously but not fatally wounded pastry shop proprietor. The pastry shop is a
  couple of miles north of Bodger''s Spinney, in that little arcade known as the One-Time
  Haunt Of Flappers. You motored away in the sidecar of your accomplice''s getaway
  motorbike, and just twenty minutes later you were sat in the snug of the Cow & Pins
  squandering your dishonestly-obtained banknotes on bottled stout.

  When the police come to arrest you, whether it be that very day or weeks, months,
  or years hence, do not say: "At the time of the pastry shop robbery I was clambering
  up a mountainside in the Himalayas carrying a crate of exotic perfumes in preparation
  for a long-overdue performance of Scriabin''s unfinished Mysterium*, officer". This
  is what we call a bonkers alibi, in that it is needlessly embroidered, easily disproved,
  and demonstrably untrue. Also many tavern-goers will have seen you swilling stout
  in the Cow & Pins within half an hour of the pastry shop robbery, and you could
  not have been in the Himalayan mountain range at that time unless you had access
  to an exciting space-age mode of transport which does not yet exist. I know that
  we were all promised our own personal booster-jet backpacks by about 1967, but it
  didn''t happen.

  Equally, you should beware of using a bonkers alibi if you are accused of a crime
  of which you are wholly innocent. In these cases, telling the truth is by far the
  best option. Imagine you are sitting at home one day, feet up, reading Celebrity
  Pap! to find out the latest doings of Stig and Fulgencio and Agamemnon and Nobo,
  or perhaps other, lesser-known celebrities, ones with besmirched careers or no careers
  at all. Suddenly, smashing their way through your window comes a heavily-armed SWAT
  team descending on rope ladders from a sinister black helicopter. A hood is pulled
  over your head, and by the time it is removed you are sitting on a chair in a basement
  you know not where, being interrogated about your participation in the slaying of
  President John F Kennedy in Dallas on 22 November 1963. Now remember, you were not
  there. At the time of the shooting, forty-three years ago, you were paddling in
  the brackish water of Fiendish Inky-Black Pond with other tots from the orphanage.
  So it would be completely bonkers for your alibi to be: "I was standing in Dealey
  Plaza next to Umbrella Man, or perhaps Marymoon Man, and then I strolled over to
  the white picket fence where I shook the gunpowder-stained hand of Badge Man, and
  then I walked off towards the triple underpass and Stemmons Freeway, officer." Quick
  as a flash, your interrogators will arrange for a screening of the Zapruder footage,
  find out that you have been lying through your teeth, and charge you with being
  part of a huge conspiracy and cover-up. And all this because you gave a bonkers
  alibi.

  BLAZING EXCELSIOR SATURATED WITH TURPENTINE

  The best way to illuminate the pitch black Pit of Doom is to toss into it some blazing
  excelsior saturated with turpentine. But that is not as easy as it sounds, mark
  my words.

  I have long argued that the Pit of Doom becomes less doom-laden when illumined,
  despite the craven voices of my opponents, and they are many. They have used the
  correspondence columns of many distinguished journals to attack my views, and I
  have until now refrained from answering their charges. They are a hectic bunch of
  cowards, ignoramuses, and pond-life, and I have had better things to do with my
  time. Why then, you might ask, do I now deign to respond to them? I have no intention
  of answering that question, but perhaps all will become clear to you as you read
  on. Or not.

  What I would like to do is to demonstrate how you can illumine the Pit of Doom yourself,
  using blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine. By following my instructions
  carefully, you will be able to reach your own decision regarding the doominess of
  the Pit once it is illumined. My hope is that you will agree with me that it is
  stripped of much, if not all, of its Doom once lit.

  First of all, of course, you need to locate the Pit of Doom. There are many pits
  which seemingly fit the bill, and many of them are shrouded in doominess, being
  bleak, unforgiving, dank, dark and hideous to behold. One of Dobson''s out of print
  pamphlets attempted to catalogue the pits in a huge geographical area which might
  qualify as doom-laden, and it was an impressive piece of work, but the pamphleteer
  overlooked the fact that when one stands on the brink of the Pit of Doom itself,
  all doubts vanish. There is a curdling of the guts that tells you exactly where
  you are. No other pit comes close. This, you say to yourself, peering into the pitch
  black maw of the Pit of Doom, this indeed is the Pit of Doom. You teeter on the
  edge, terrified of losing your balance, every nerve in your body ready to snap.
  But you step back, if you are me, anyway, and resolve to banish doom by the simple
  agency of blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine.

  And that is your next challenge. Having located the Pit of Doom, you must now get
  your hands on excelsior, turpentine, and a box of matches, or some equivalent means
  of ignition. And so you turn your back on the Pit of Doom, almost insolently, and
  you stride across the moors to the little hovel you noted earlier, and you rap your
  knuckles on the door.

  You are expecting a snag-toothed peasant person to answer your rapping, and so you
  are momentarily disconcerted when the hovel-door creaks open and you are confronted
  by a winsome young woman who bears a striking resemblance to Tuesday Weld.

  "Greetings," you manage to say, "I come in search of excelsior, turpentine, and
  a means of ignition."

  "Then you have come to the right place," says the Tuesday Weld-like woman, "For
  here in my hovel I have all those things."

  She ushers you inside, and you are stunned by the interior, which is done out with
  much velvet and satin and silk, with vases of cut flowers, with space-age plastic
  furniture in a dazzle of colours, all bathed in an unearthly shimmering light. You
  are mesmerised by this light. Entire days pass by, of which you are unconscious,
  for you have been captivated by a woohoo woman who is rearranging your brain cells
  one by one, for purposes either malignant or beneficial, depending on what kind
  of woohoo woman she is. When you wake from your entrancement, you find that she
  has placed in your hands a bag of excelsior, a bottle of turpentine, and a box of
  lucifers. You have been fortunate. She is a woohoo woman devoted to good.

  "Go now," she says, "And do what you must do."

  You are not aware that your brain has been tampered with, nor indeed that you have
  been entranced. You step out of the light, out of the hovel, and make your way across
  the moors to the Pit of Doom.

  Crouching near its edge, you open the bag of excelsior. It is imperative that you
  check that it is uninhabited, for hamsters sleep all curled and comfortable in excelsior,
  as do hibernating tortoises, and other creatures, excepting those whose domain is
  the sea. You rummage through the excelsior until you are completely satisfied that
  it is innocent of life, hamster or otherwise. Then you open the bottle of turpentine
  and pour in such an amount that the excelsior is saturated. Then you seal the bag
  to ensure that the turpentine does not evaporate. Then you set fire to it with one
  of the lucifers, and then you toss it into the Pit of Doom.

  Now you step even closer to the edge, and you peer down into what was until a moment
  ago an evil, pitch black vent into the underworld, but now is lit. What do you see?

  I could tell you what I saw, on the day last September that I illumined the Pit
  of Doom with blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine. I could speak of the unimaginable
  horrors I saw, writhing in terror of the light, of the howling that beset my ears.
  I could, had I too not had my brain jimmied by the very same Tuesday Weldish woohoo
  woman, whose mercy means that everything I saw or heard in the Pit of Doom, lit
  by blazing excelsior, is forgotten, forevermore, for now I bask in that shimmering
  light, dressed in my peasant''s smock, chewing on a piece of straw, at long last
  the idiot I always hankered to be.


  ELEGANT SMUDGES

  It was, he thought, a very elegant smudge, as smudges go.

  "Look at this smudge," he said to his companion, pointing at the smudge with his
  forefinger, "Do you not think it elegant?"

  His companion looked at the smudge, tossed her head, and then fixed him with an
  inscrutable gaze.

  "You do not think it elegant?" he said, as a beetle crawled out of his tousled hair
  and launched itself into the shimmering air. It was a flying beetle.

  So begins one of Dobson''s few attempts at writing fiction. And so, too, does it
  end, for he never wrote another word of what, only that morning, he had confided
  to his diary was to be "a brilliant money-spinning scheme... I will write a potboiler,
  a guaranteed bestseller, a novel of triumph over adversity, with a dashing hero
  and a sultry heroine, a helter skelter adventure of international intrigue, high
  finance, technological wizardry and scrupulously-researched background detail. It
  cannot fail!"

  He scribbled those last three words with such vim that he rent the paper in his
  journal, and it was thick, creamy paper to boot, not easily rent. Forensic Dobsonist
  Jim Pond sees the rending as evidence of just how excited the out-of-print pamphleteer
  was on that March morning of glistening torrential showers and fractious gales.

  "Dobson often lost all sense of reason when hatching a new scheme," writes Mr Pond
  in a new article*, "but seldom can he have been so deluded as this. For at least
  four hours on that rain-mad March morning he seems to have been utterly convinced
  that the novel he called Elegant Smudges would not only be bought in the millions
  by an adoring public, but that he would actually write the damned thing in the first
  place."

  As is evident from the opening--and only--lines Dobson managed to jot down, the
  brilliant pamphleteer was a hopeless fictioneer. Mr Pond has unearthed a few working
  notes that Dobson made in the hours between his paper-rending journal entry and
  the abandoned beginning of the novel. "I think we are lucky," he writes, "that Dobson
  stopped when he did, flung his pencil across the room, and strode out of the house
  in his big Canadian Forestry Service boots to enjoy the downpour."

  According to Mr Pond, Dobson was under the impression that a series of fifty-nine
  chapters, in each of which two unnamed protagonists examine a smudge, and disagree
  as to whether or not the smudge is elegant, constituted the makings of an unputdownable
  novel. Granted, each chapter was to be set in a different milieu, the smudges, elegant
  or otherwise, to be found in a bewildering variety of locations, but as Mr Pond
  points out, Dobson''s notes list only "international airport" and "municipal bus
  depot". Where the other fifty-seven smudges were to be is, as Alexander Scriabin
  might have put it, a Mysterium**. And did Dobson really think that readers would
  be turning the pages, breathless with excitement, awaiting the appearance in each
  chapter of a flying beetle?

  Meteorological records for that day in March indicate that the teeming rainfall
  lasted until well into the afternoon. Having cast aside his pencil, and his aborted
  novel, Dobson, as we have seen, headed out into the soaking wet world. He returned,
  drenched of course, some hours later, having somehow managed to obtain certain obscure
  pastries from an unknown pie shop. These diverted his attention for the rest of
  the day, and by the time he collapsed in an exhausted heap onto his mattress of
  straw, the elegant smudges were forgotten.

  In an infuriating addendum to his article, Mr Pond notes that the word smudge only
  occurs once more in the corpus of the pamphleteer''s work, but he does not tell
  us where. This sort of thing makes my blood boil, so I am going to go out and throw
  things at squirrels until I have calmed down.

  TEN DAYS IN A DITCH

  Sometimes you just have to go and lie down in a ditch. That''s what I did a week
  or so ago, and I have only just returned home. It is definitely time for a bath,
  but I have to say that my ditchdom was thoroughly splendid in every way.

  For one thing, the ditch was a muddy one, muddy and puddle-strewn. And such gorgeous
  puddles! I studied puddles in an academic context some years ago, so I know, for
  example, that the Latin for puddle is lacusculus, which may more accurately be translated
  as little pool, but will do for our present purposes. Some of the lacusculi (or
  -ae) in my ditch were foul and deep. Others were shallow little things, almost vestiges
  of puddle. Each one had its own character, and I would have enjoyed counting them
  if I could remember how to count.

  Did you notice how easily I said "my ditch"? I had not been lying in it for very
  long before it lost its anonymity and became my treasured, if temporary, possession,
  the way a medieval baron would boast of huge tracts of forest as being his "possessions".
  It was in medieval times that a map was made of this area which shows some of the
  many ditches, and even gives them names. Some of the ditches have vanished, of course,
  while new ones have come into being, but there are a few that have existed for hundreds
  of years. I cannot be sure whether the ditch I chose was called Bentley or Abercrombie,
  so I may make a trip to the library to consult a facsimile of the old map after
  I have had my bath.

  While I was lying in the ditch, I didn''t give much thought to its name. I admired
  the puddles, as I have said, and I looked at the sky, at fugitive clouds, at birds
  in flight, particularly hummingbirds and wrens, for I have always favoured smaller
  birds. Large birds terrify me. I fear being pecked, and I begin to tremble. When
  I saw large birds overhead, I rolled over on to my front and looked at the mud,
  or closed my eyes.

  With eyes shut I sometimes fell into a ditchy fitful sleep, but more often I allowed
  my mind to wander. I have been preoccupied lately with the fictional athlete Bobnit
  Tivol, having found a whole stash of illustrated booklets about him underneath the
  sink in the kitchen of my new set of rooms. Reading them avidly at a single sitting,
  I had been perplexed to discover that as well as being a champion sprinter, fictional
  athlete Bobnit Tivol had also won a number of medals and cups for the pole-vault.
  Thus, I had to alter my mental image of him, and I admit I found this difficult.
  For so long he had inhabited my brain breasting the tape after a particularly gruelling
  sprint, a bit like the famous photograph of Roger Bannister breaking the four minute
  mile at Iffley Road running track on the sixth of May 1954 (see below). I say "a
  bit like" because of course fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol sported a huge beard,
  a piratical eyepatch, and often--and mysteriously--had breadcrumbs in his hair.
  Nor should we forget that wherever he ran, he always took his little gaggle of pet
  poultry with him, which would wait, clucking, near the finishing line, much to the
  consternation of various athletics officials in their spotless blazers, some of
  them with whistles on lanyards around their necks, and some without.


  So this was the eidolon of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol that I had cherished for
  years and years, and now it had to be revised. I had to try to imagine him pole-vaulting.
  You may now be able to appreciate why I spent ten days lying in that ditch, Bentley
  or Abercrombie, without once getting bored. I will confess that I did not maintain
  my concentration uninterrupted, for there were many distractions. Leaving aside
  for a moment the birds, large and small, which I could see as they flew overhead,
  there were earthworms, beetles, the occasional mole, just one ant, all by itself,
  which had obviously strayed from its fellows, and a number of other life-forms which
  I did not recognise or cannot remember. There were gusts of wind which rippled the
  surfaces of the puddles. There was one spectacular rainstorm from which I sheltered
  by intoning a spell. And then there was Codrington.

  I do not wish to dwell upon Codrington, for to do so is very painful. Suffice it
  to say that I cannot shake him off. He has been following me now for at least seventeen
  years. I thought I was safe in my ditch, and for the first four days I was. Then,
  at dawn on the fifth day, icy tentacles clawed at my heart as I heard the unmistakeable
  sound of his humming, his footsteps, his creaking bones. And there he was, clambering
  down into my ditch, squatting a few feet away from me, his gleaming black boots
  submerged in one of my favourite puddles. He pretended to ignore me, of course,
  as he always does. He hummed and creaked and creaked and hummed. It took a titanic
  effort of will for me to remain lying in my ditch, Bentley or Abercrombie, now supine,
  staring at the sky, and the birds in the sky, now prone, my face in the mud, summoning
  the image of fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol both sprinting and pole-vaulting, his
  poultry loyally at his side. And I succeeded. Yesterday, on my last day in the ditch,
  that new image swam before my eyes at the very moment that Codrington, with a final
  creak and hum, stood up, hoisted himself out of the ditch, and stalked away across
  the fields, frightening some cows as he passed, but allowing me some respite from
  his gruesome presence.

  And now I am at home, and about to have a bath, and there is a mud-splattered envelope
  addressed to me resting on the mantelpiece. I know that the handwriting is Codrington''s.
  He has left one of his communiques. Do I read it or set fire to it? Or do I do neither,
  and go back to my ditch? What would fictional athlete Bobnit Tivol have done? He
  shall be my guide.
