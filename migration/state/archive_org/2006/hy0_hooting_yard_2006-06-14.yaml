  The Big Metal Fence - 07:41'
full_text: 'ON FIENDS OF THE FARMYARD

  [A slightly shorter version of this piece appeared in June 2006.]

  There is, or may have been, an old superstition that every farmyard has its own
  fiend. It is said that Beelzebub personally allotted each fiend to its farmyard,
  and ratcheted up the fiendishness of his dastardly plan by making the fiends extremely
  hard to identify. So, for example, neighbouring farmyards may have very, very different
  resident fiends--a pig here, an old rusty iron pail there, a one-legged hen in one
  farmyard and a big bright red tractor belching smoke in another. Exorcising a farmyard
  of its fiend is thus fraught with difficulty, for the average countryside exorcist,
  stepping through the gate of a farmyard for the first time, does not know where
  to begin to look.

  There is great disparity in the fiendishness of farmyard fiends, and some diabolists
  have argued that Beelzebub treated the whole matter with an uncharacteristic lack
  of diabolic concentration. For every farmyard that is stricken by an energetic fiend,
  there are many more that can pass for years, even decades, in untroubled bucolic
  peace. But of course it is the former that gain attention. Who can forget the ruination
  visited upon Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard in the 1930s, all those crop failures, diseases,
  fires, murders, contaminations and inexplicable barn collapses, which ceased only
  when a marauding night-time squirrel was captured in a net by Father Dermot Boggis
  and subjected to the full rigour of his holy wrath? It took six months for the exorcist
  to expel every last vestige of fiendishness from the squirrel, leaving the poor
  bushy-tailed mammal thin and shrivelled and exhausted and close to death. And yet,
  as it was slowly revived by the coddling of Old Ma Purgative at her verdant squirrel
  sanctuary, so too did the farmyard flourish anew, with majestic fields of golden
  wheat, gleaming new buckets replacing the old rusty pails, and happy, happy pigs.

  You would be forgiven for thinking that the taxonomy of farmyard fiends is precisely
  the kind of subject to which Dobson would have devoted a pamphlet or two. Indeed,
  Marigold Chew often pressed him to tackle the topic, supplying the out of print
  pamphleteer with a constant stream of newspaper cuttings about hideous devastations
  of an agricultural kidney. She was a subscriber to the once popular monthly magazine
  Glimpses Of Farmyard Ruin, and wrote many letters to the editor, some of which were
  published and one of which (October 1954) was selected as ''Letter of the Month'',
  for which Marigold received a prize. Unfortunately, the prize was a very large hog
  with a brain disease which went on wild rampages through the house. Mischievously,
  the editor of the magazine, who had his own farmyard, regularly used the monthly
  prize to rid himself of his farmyard fiends.

  Ah yes, note the plural. What happens, you will ask, when a fiend of the farmyard
  is identified and destroyed, whether by slaughter, exorcism, or being given away
  as a prize in a raffle, tombola, or by some other means, as happened with Marigold
  Chew? Did Scroonhoonpooge Farmyard stay fiend-free once its sinister squirrel had
  its demons cast out? How attentive was Beelzebub to the welfare of those he had
  sent to wreak havoc in our bosky rural domains? Were new fiends recruited and trained
  to carry out various infernal farmyard acts of fiendishness? These and other questions
  were answered by Father Dermot Boggis himself, in his deathbed ravings, carefully
  transcribed by his wrinkled old helpmeet, the widow Popsicle. Among the thousands
  of pages she scribbled, we find this startling passage:

  Gaaaa... gaaaa... inexplicable torment of the devil''s long poking fork... his ladle...
  cataclysm of shuddering abasement in the pit... and when did you last see your potatoes?...
  gaaaa... have the fields been hoed?... I see hundreds of cows... thousands of cows...
  millions of cows... brutes... the flames of the fiery furnace... a crow on the branch
  of a dead tree... blasts of lightning... no diesel for the tractor... blight!...
  blight!... worms eating the flesh of resurrected horses... never resurrect a horse...
  never... pass me that feeble lamp... puddles of sludge and slop and constant rainfall...
  forty days and forty nights... flooded fields... the wheat ruined... ergot poisoning...
  a gruesome figure in the shroud of death... find me a lonely cave... remote from
  human kind... dark as the midnight grave... and dismal as my mind... gaaaa...

  And with that last brief flash of lucidity, the remembered words of John Eccles
  (c.1688-1735), Father Boggis relapsed into inanity, the verbatim record covering
  four hundred pages'' worth of the widow Popsicle''s palsied pencil-scrawl. The clue
  to the farmyard fiends'' damnable resilience is, I think, in that reference to the
  crow perched on the branch of a dead tree. Think about it. But don''t think too
  hard, for then all you will see in your mind''s eye is the bird and the branch.
  You need to let the thought of the crow on the branch of a dead tree flit into your
  brain, like a swooping bat, and then out again. You need to think of it with the
  mental equivalent of peripheral vision. You need to try not to think about it, just
  as Gordon Zellaby tries not to think about the bomb he has planted to kill the Midwich
  Cuckoos in John Wyndham''s novel of 1957, filmed as Village Of The Damned in 1960,
  directed by Wolf Rilla and starring George Sanders as the heroic, academic, and
  terminally ill Zellaby. Wyndham''s fiends are not specifically farmyard fiends,
  but close enough, close enough. Close enough, too, to little Martin Amis, as can
  be seen by comparing these two pictures, one of little Mart when tiny, the other
  a still from the film.



  But now the dawn is near. The sun will soon be lighting your path to the far flung
  fields. Go and till and plough and harrow, feed your horses and your cows and your
  happy, happy pigs. You may spit upon your farmyard fiend. It will pester you no
  more. It was only ever a superstition, or it might have been.


  THE BIG METAL FENCE

  Here is another much-requested piece. Although I have read it, more than once, on
  the radio, it has never appeared in written form anywhere. I was planning an anthology
  of stories in 1993, just before the Wilderness Years, of which this would have formed
  a part, but that book never did see the light of day. As with The Book Of Gnats,
  if I were writing the story today it would be different, here and there, but I have
  left it in its original state, more or less.

  Freakishly tall, draped in a soutane, my brain pounding, I found myself standing
  before a trench full of sludge. In each hand, I discovered I was holding a bucket
  of pungent goo. My feet were encased in sturdy plastic bootees and at least two
  pairs of socks. I squelched across the trench, each step expelling from the sludge
  noisome fumes that wafted in the air behind me, shimmering and stinking. After some
  minutes, I clambered on to the other side, and rested the buckets upon the ground.
  Sulphurous fires ablaze within my skull, I had made the crossing from LIFE into
  DEATH. Eternity was before me.

  That was six weeks ago, and I have now prepared this preliminary report of my impressions.
  I do not doubt that as further aeons pass, what follows may appear naive, churlish
  and inaccurate. I shall file a more detailed report in ten billion years or so,
  and it will be instructive for scholars to compare the two documents. I repeat:
  these are very much first impressions.

  In marshalling my material, I have plunged the majority of my notes into the Chute
  Of Rack And Ruin, which is on the mezzanine floor of the larger of the Two Damp
  Buildings. First, because to include everything would make this report too long
  and unwieldy. Second, because I have come to enjoy the whirring and clanking noises
  emitted by the Chute when it is put into operation. It is my fondest hope that,
  however limited and fragmentary the material, my readers will nonetheless gain a
  useful insight into what awaits them after death.

  So far I have discovered four pubs: The Butcher''s Vest, The Consumptive Stalinist,
  The Tenth Chaffinch, and The Smouldering Maw. To get into the latter, you must be
  in possession of a special ticket issued by the River Police, whose headquarters
  is in a small hut at the bottom of a flight of stone steps a few hundred yards north
  of the Moribund Dam. To get into the hut, however, you need a licence from the Buffed-Up
  Shield Committee, which meets only once every four thousand years. It is typical
  of my luck that it met just two days before I arrived here. From what I have heard,
  The Smouldering Maw has the very best drinks in the afterlife, and what''s more
  they are free. My friend Ringchock, who has been here for untold centuries, recommends
  a peculiar brew they serve called The Hoist. It is effervescent, curdled, of a startling
  lavender tinge, and after four pints you get to join Captain Snap''s Committee,
  of which more later.

  I have been able to get in to the other three pubs mentioned, none of which has
  any restrictions on entry. The Butcher''s Vest is the only one worthy of repeated
  visits. Its landlord, a bat-eared titan whose name is unpronounceable, comes from
  the same village as me, although he lived there many centuries before I was born.
  We have had many little chats, although his speech is hard for me to follow, as
  he is toothless, and slobbers uncontrollably. The range of drinks is somewhat limited,
  but the landlord provides enticing snacks for his regular customers. Each of the
  tables has a bowl of boiling hot custard on it, into which one can dip a staggering
  selection of biscuits, crackers, buns, tarts and pastries. Often these are stale,
  but when moistened with sufficient custard they are quite palatable. The tables
  are rickety, though, so one must be careful to avoid spillages, which enrage the
  landlord to the point where his hair stands on end, his face turns purple, and he
  gets his cronies to hurl the offender into an open sewer which runs past the back
  door.

  You may find it difficult to believe, but absolutely everyone here is dressed from
  head to foot in corduroy. When I made the crossing, you will recall I was wearing
  a soutane. I have no idea why. At Reception, however, I was ushered into a little
  cubicle and given a set of corduroy apparel to change into: hat, shirt, jerkin,
  underpants, pantaloons, socks and moccasins. The soutane was taken away and I have
  not seen it since. Later, when I was taken to my quarters, I discovered a wardrobe
  full of corduroy clothing.

  Ah yes, my quarters. What is accommodation like on the other side of the grave?
  Well, pokey. The population is, of course, ever-increasing, so overcrowding is a
  seemingly insoluble problem. Contrary to popular belief, as far as I can remember,
  we do not have unlimited space. Those who have been here for an unimaginably long
  time can only dimly remember when they had a small room all to themselves.

  I share my tiny cabin with seven others. Binns was a whaling captain. Al Aqbuz ran
  a luxury hotel. Rosemary and Lettice, who perished together in one of the earliest
  railway accidents, were distressed gentlewomen; they still are, come to that. Scrut
  was some sort of hill-peasant. Nugg, our longest-serving resident, appears to have
  been a caveman as far as any of us can tell. He smells astonishingly unpleasant.
  Min Toc Thing babbles endlessly about her glorious life in an imperial palace of
  the Orient, and treats the rest of us with contempt.

  Thrown together with dead people whose lives were so different, it might be thought
  that the afterlife is one long round of fascinating conversations, broadened horizons,
  and limitless opportunity to compare ideas, feelings, throbs, pangs, perceptions
  and beliefs. Would that it were so! Unfortunately, language acquisition (and, indeed,
  any kind of mental development) simply does not happen here. Thus, Nugg is locked
  in his strange and distant world, goes out of his mind with confusion when he sees
  a wheel, for example, and spends most of his time grunting, hammering his fists
  on the floor, and defecating where the fancy takes him. Binns told me an uproarious
  story about how he once took Nugg with him to The Butcher''s Vest and forced eight
  pints of grut down the poor wretch''s throat. In the resulting mayhem, Nugg smashed
  the pub to smithereens before passing out quite happily in the sewer, where he spent
  the next year or so recovering.

  The fact that we all wear virtually identical corduroy clothing also makes things
  difficult. You simply can''t tell whether the person lounging by the bus stop is
  a thirteenth century Mongolian warlord, a Victorian entomologist, the murdered heir
  to the throne of Finland, a milkman from Wivenhoe, an arch-druid, a CIA assassin,
  a Baltic potato farmer, one of Hannibal''s mahouts, Ethelred the Unready, or an
  ex-pope. The chances are that any attempt you make at light conversation will be
  doomed from the start through mutual unintelligibility, so after a while you don''t
  even bother to try. I have only been here for six weeks, and am already affected
  by this social lethargy.

  Our cramped living conditions are intolerable, and it is not surprising that fights
  and squabbles are common. I try to spend most of my time out and about, going back
  home only to sleep. In my first week, I made inquiries about changing cabins, but
  to do so is apparently impossible. They have a massive ledger at Reception, and
  they pencil in your name against whatever accommodation is available, and that''s
  it, for ever and ever and ever.

  I have been given a job at the dairy. We have thousands of cows, an efficient bottling
  plant, good refrigeration facilities, and a delivery system that runs like clockwork.
  Buttermilk is increasingly popular, and we also produce sour cream, cheeses, yoghurt,
  and very nice little cartons of whey. Of course, fresh milk forms the bulk of our
  production, and although we no longer do home deliveries, we make sure that the
  milk-kiosks are always fully stocked. After a month in the single cream department,
  I was promoted. I am now Captain Of The Churns, and I wear a special badge.

  The spiritualists among you will be pleased to hear that this place is fairly riddled
  with ectoplasm. Viscous, refulgent, and shimmering, it hovers above the rooftops,
  curls in wisps in every room, darts hither and thither in the air wherever one cares
  to look. What purpose it serves is a mystery. There are scholars here, of course,
  and many of them are using Eternity to puzzle over this enigmatic substance. Books
  roll off the presses in frightening quantities. On a visit to the library last week,
  I noted the following titles, all of them published since my arrival: The Ectoplasmic
  Gazetteer; The Lustre Of Ectoplasm; Two Noddles On A Bight; Ectoplasmus--Essays
  In Hieratic Crumpling; Heaven''s Porridge; Ectoplasmic Phantasms; and Ectoplasm''s
  New Hub--An Ibarguengoitian Summary. Learned journals devoted to the subject are
  piled high in corridors and pavilions. Hot and hate-filled debates are broadcast
  on the radio, as two or more experts dispute each other''s theories, shouting their
  heads off and resorting to infantile bickering.

  True fanatics spend months at a time in the Ectoplasm Park, near the railway sidings,
  where the gleaming substance has somehow been corralled and controlled, hanging
  low in the air above a large circle of verdant lawns. The visitor to the Park is
  literally enveloped in ectoplasm, breathing it in through every pore. What the effects
  are of such exposure I do not know, as I have yet to experience them. Needless to
  say, those who visit the Park come away with wildly different stories to tell. The
  letters columns of the ectoplasm journals are full of first-hand reports, the writers''
  reactions varying from blinding ecstasy to stultifying boredom. I will not bother
  to reproduce any of this verbiage here. You will have time enough to read it when
  you are dead.

  I have yet to meet Captain Snap, but stories about him are rife. Most of them seem
  to be about the various high-jinks and scamperies he got up to when he was alive.
  Ask about his role in the afterlife and there is an ominous, even terrified, silence.
  No one appears to know which cabin he lives in, if, indeed, he lives in a cabin
  at all. On a promontory by the Mud Wastes there stands an enormous, misshapen castle,
  like something out of a child''s nightmare. Some insist that Captain Snap inhabits
  it, surrounded by minions, but this seems unlikely. Every month there are charabanc
  outings to the castle, and the tourists, chosen by raffle-ticket, are able to roam
  all around it at will. Perhaps Captain Snap hides in the broom cupboard, or makes
  himself scarce, during these visits. Who knows?

  Most people are only able to drink half a pint of The Hoist before passing out,
  so rigorous training is necessary if one aspires to join Captain Snap''s Committee.
  As with so much else here, the Committee''s function is a mystery. Opinions vary.
  There are those who accuse the Committee of regulating every aspect of the afterlife.
  Others say it is merely a drinking club. Binns swears blind that the members are
  able to return to earth, for short periods, as ghosts, but that for some reason
  they are only able to haunt desolate, winter-wracked seaside resorts. I am sure
  he is just making that up.

  As with ectoplasm, so with grace. There is a vast amount of it here. When I was
  alive, I remember that Christians used to bang on about grace all the time, but
  I must admit I never worked out precisely what it was. From what I did gather, however,
  I can confidently say that, as with most aspects of the afterlife, they were very
  wide of the mark.

  At Reception, they give you a large tub of grace and tell you to look after it very
  carefully, and not to open it until you get the word. Not that they are trusting.
  Being a curious sort, I tried to open my tub as soon as I got to my cabin, and discovered
  that it had a safety catch on the lid, a nasty little mechanism which snapped over
  my fingers and clamped them tight against the tub so that I howled in agony. Binns,
  chuckling at my naivety, sent me off to the Tub Inspectors, who freed my fingers,
  dabbed them with ointment, reset the catch, and gave me a ticking-off.

  As for "the word", upon receipt of which I can open my tub, to date I have not met
  a single person who has ever been given it. Everybody has their pristine, unopened
  tub. Some people carry them around with them, although personally I find the pockets
  on our clothing are not roomy enough. You can buy little wicker baskets, into which
  the tubs fit quite snugly, and you see those quite often. But like most people,
  I keep my tub of grace in a tiny wooden locker in my cabin.

  The postal system is charming. Rickshaws, stacked with packets and parcels, and
  pulled along by brightly-uniformed Prussians, career through the streets, if "street"
  is the correct word for the stinking, muddy channels which criss-cross our domain.
  For some reason you have to be a Prussian who died during the nineteenth century
  to get a job as a postal worker. This seems to me rather unfair, and were I not
  so happy at the dairy I would raise a stink about it. When I first learned about
  this closed-shop employment practice, I assumed that the Prussians got the jobs
  because, with their stereotypical passion for order, they ran a tight ship and kept
  stern bureaucratic control of so potentially chaotic a service. I soon discovered
  how wrong I was. The great thing about the postal system here is that it is entirely
  random. You can write a letter, tie up a parcel, shove a few nick-nacks into a packet,
  and deposit it in a postbox, and you simply never know who the recipient will be.
  If you waste your time carefully addressing your mail to a particular individual,
  you are summoned to the Post Office Headquarters and made to do an hour''s stamp-licking
  duty, while ferocious hounds bay at you from an adjoining room.

  There is a big metal fence completely surrounding this place. It is electrified.
  I have spent long hours peering through its mesh of lethal wires, trying to see
  what lies beyond it, but all I can make out is an indistinct beige and mauve blur.
  A distant, mesmerising clamour is just about audible. Those who have tried to cross
  it have found themselves instantly surrounded by gangs of brutish myrmidons, whose
  golden helmets are burnished and gleaming. Merciless and inexplicable, they enwrap
  their captives in grey corduroy shrouds, intone a litany of awfulness and dread,
  and convey them at hideous speed to the mezzanine floor of the Big Damp Building,
  whence they are despatched, muffled, stricken and aghast, into the Chute Of Rack
  And Ruin. As it whirrs and clanks, they are forever swept away, they are swept away
  and gone.'
