full_text: 'THE OGSBY STEERING PANEL

  Last week I had an extraordinary stroke of good fortune. Ever since the afternoon
  of Friday last, I have been engulfed in a flood of memories, and I am discombobulated
  and a-dither, quite unlike my usual self.

  I was wandering the streets of Pointy Town, somewhat aimlessly, and as I turned
  a particular corner I felt compelled--there is no other word for it--to head off
  down a dark, narrow alleyway where lurked a strange little shop. Do you remember
  the scene towards the end of Random Harvest (1942), where Charles Rainier, played
  by Ronald Colman, turns down a side-street to go to a tobacconist, and then wonders
  how he knew it was there, this being a town he has never knowingly visited before,
  and how his consternation is the spur to his gradual recollection of the life that
  a traffic accident has wiped from his memory, leading, within a few minutes of film-time,
  to the tear-stained scene where he and Paula (Greer Garson) are reunited at the
  gates of their idyllic country cottage? Well, as I entered the shop in that Pointy
  Town alleyway, I had a very similar jolt to my memory, although I am not a veteran
  of the First World War whose shell shock had led to total amnesia and a reluctance
  to speak, like Charles Rainier. Readers who have no idea what I am gabbling on about
  should take steps to see this magnificent film at the earliest opportunity. I guarantee
  that even those with the flintiest of hearts will be sobbing copiously by the end,
  not that Hooting Yard readers tend to be flinty-hearted, as a general rule, according
  to the latest readership profiles gathered by Fatima Gilliblat and her team of wastrels.


  The shop into which I tottered, having tripped on a thing discarded in the alleyway,
  was not a tobacconist. It was called, I noted, This Vale Of Tears, and its unexpectedly
  neon-bright interior contained a heteroclite jumble of items for sale. I can only
  call them odds and ends. Battered biscuit tins, dishcloths, iron utensils of no
  apparent utility, bags full of swan feathers, rubber inhaling tubes, dog-eared snapshots
  of goats, pigs, and barnyard animals in general, buckets and pails, packets of cupcake
  mixture, fawn overslings from a stage production of Tap Or Spigot?, fruit made out
  of wax, fold-out wiring diagrams, wiring, cheesecloth, pastry cases, bound copies
  of The Propeller, abandoned and in some cases broken sandwich boards, a stuffed
  crow, litmus paper, human hair braided into rope for ships, surgery-ready canisters,
  pin cushions, Toc H lamps, fahrenheit converters, big forks, rotating wooden cubes
  on a spindle, frozen blobs, an information poster showing the correct pronunciation
  of "yoghurt" (that is, "yo-hoort"), tassels, baubles and bells, some of them enormous
  bells from a famous foundry, annals of jurisprudence, kitchen whisks, repair kits
  for the irreparable, teaspoons, marzipan, clock springs, grease in balls, a thanatophore,
  a marble bust of the head of Ringo Starr, lanterns, rattles, fripperies, saws, starched
  white butchers'' curtains, and there, in among it all, still in its dust-caked packaging,
  but otherwise pristine, an original series Ogsby''s Steering Panel.

  Were you lucky enough, when you were a tiny tot, to receive an Ogsby''s Steering
  Panel as a birthday gift? I was. I still remember with absolute clarity waking on
  the icy cold morning of my tenth birthday, and finding at the foot of my bed a rectangular
  object wrapped in old newspaper, on which either my father or my mother had scribbled
  in crayon "Happy Birthday To Our Ten-Year-Old". I was a dutiful and pious child,
  so before tearing the package open I repaired to the bathroom to brush my teeth
  and plunge my head into a sink full of icy water, and then I went downstairs to
  find my parents.

  My mother was in the garden slaughtering insects. I thanked her for my gift and
  asked where my father was so I could thank him too. She gave me a woebegone look
  and patted me on the head, mussing my hair in which icicles were beginning to form.

  "I am afraid your father had to take the dawn train to a secret military establishment
  at an undisclosed coastal location--towering cliffs, monstrous waves, shingle--where
  he will be cooped up for the next six months helping to devise counter-intelligence
  techniques for use against an enemy so powerful, so ruthless, so fiendish, that
  it beggars belief," said my mother, and she tapped the side of her nose, indicating
  that this startling news was to be kept under my hat, had I but a hat to keep it
  under.

  "Gosh!" I replied, "So papa is not, as he appears to all and sundry, a simple village
  potato shop person. That is but a cover for his real work, which is of national--no,
  international--importance. Well I never."

  "It is indeed so," said my mother, "And as it is your birthday I am going to make
  a present to you of a hat, and you must promise like the dutiful and pious child
  you are to keep this world-shattering revelation underneath it until you reach your
  majority."

  "I will do so, mama," I promised. Her mention of a present recalled my mind to the
  rectangular package at the foot of the bed. It seemed unlikely that it contained
  a hat. It was as if my mother read my thoughts.

  "The hat is an extra gift," she said, "For your proper present is the one in the
  rectangular newspaper-wrapped package at the foot of your bed. Go and open it now
  and leave me to my slaughter of aphids."

  I ran upstairs and tore open the rectangular newspaper-wrapped package at the foot
  of my bed. Is it possible to convey to you the sheer joy with which my entire being
  was convulsed when I saw that I had been given an original series Ogsby''s Steering
  Panel? There it was, new and gleaming, with its little knobs and levers, and the
  red bakelite prong on one side and the rubber speaking funnel on the other, the
  braille-like raised round nodes next to the hooter, the metal snags, the clip-on
  flaps, and so many, many dials!

  I think I played with it constantly for the next three hours, until the terrible
  moment when my father suddenly crashed through the door of my room, ashen-faced
  and trembling, and tore the original series Ogsby''s Steering Panel from my puny
  little hands.

  "I have had to jet back here suddenly, son," he said, in a voice broken by strain,
  "Our powerful, ruthless, and fiendish enemy is within minutes of unleashing a plot
  so intricate, so tangled, just so damned bonkers that the very future of the globe
  is in direst peril. Only by dismantling your new original series Ogsby''s Steering
  Panel and using the parts for our top secret counter-attack machine will the world
  be saved, to guarantee that children like you have a future free from fear of all
  that is fiendish. I''m sure you understand."

  And he was gone, and I was left alone on the floor of my room, dutiful and pious,
  and I never saw my birthday gift again. Oh yes, the world was saved, the powerful
  and ruthless and fiendish enemy was foiled, my heroic father resumed his humble
  potato shop person persona, and my mother eradicated all insect life from our domain,
  but I always felt a sense of unbearable loss, until last week, when I stumbled upon
  an original series Ogsby''s Steering Panel hidden behind an array of papier mache
  dustbin lids in This Vale Of Tears, in that gloomy alley in Pointy Town, and the
  long, insufferable, melancholy years were swept away, and I was ten again, with
  icicles in my hair.


  SAVING YOUR SWAN

  As the deadly bird flu virus sweeps inexorably westward--France is the latest country
  to report a case--it is vitally important that you take preventative measures to
  ensure your pet swan, or swans, do not fall victim to the virus. If you act in time,
  your swan will not have to be culled by a wellington-booted government official
  armed with a gun or some poison pellets.

  The simplest way to save the life of your swan is to lure it indoors and keep it
  there. If you do so, the virus can lay waste all outdoor bird life for as far as
  you can see, but your indoor swan will be snug and secure, so long as you batten
  down the hatches and allow no other birds into your house. There will be no point
  keeping your swan indoors if you then invite in any passing eagle, chaffinch, vulture,
  starling or peewit.

  I am assuming for the purposes of this advisory note that you have only one swan.
  If you have two or more pet swans, you will find the technique outlined here equally
  effective.


  Left, Jim Zingo''s swans. Right, Peter Maxwell Davies

  Swans are independent-minded birds, and no matter how devoted a swan-keeper you
  are, they will always prefer to glide up and down the river or lake looking graceful
  and showing off their beautiful profiles than to be housebound and cloistered. You
  might think it is a simple matter of plucking your swan from the water, tucking
  it under your arm, carrying it indoors, and putting it on the sofa. Do try to remember,
  however, that swans can be very aggressive. Next time you are with your swan, look
  at its face, very close to, and tell me if you do not see a cold, hard, alien savagery.

  You are probably thinking that luring your swan indoors is a simple matter of laying
  a trail of breadcrumbs and millet, or other seeds, from the edge of the lake across
  the muddy field and in through your front door to the living room. Not so. Most
  swans, however famished, will baulk at entering a building. They will peck eagerly
  away until they get to the door, but are then almost certain to turn around and
  return to the lake, chancing that more food will appear before long--and it will,
  you can be sure of that.

  Can a swan be lured indoors by placing a decoy swan in your living room? This is
  possible, but your decoy must be thoroughly convincing. It not only needs to look
  like a swan, and sound like a swan, but ideally it should smell like a swan too.
  You are not going to succeed by bundling up some old net curtains, blackening a
  portion with charcoal to resemble the head, and covering it in weeds dragged from
  the lake. Your swan will take one cold, pitiless look at it, turn around, and waddle
  back to the lake, possibly lunging to bite your hand as it leaves.

  What you need to do, if you are to have an indoor swan safe from bird flu, is to
  make your living room a more attractive environment for it than its usual lake,
  pond, or river habitat. This is where a bank of loudspeakers and a tape loop of
  music by ''Sir'' Peter Maxwell Davies comes in. The Master of the Queen''s Music
  is well-known for his swan-eating habits*, and no sane swan wants to be boiled and
  gobbled down for dinner, whether by an important contemporary composer or by a tone-deaf
  ingrate like you. Swans have a collective unconscious that baffles ornithologists,
  and ever since Maxwell Davies found an electrocuted whooper swan and took it back
  to his kitchen, his music strikes terror into their palpitating swan-hearts. The
  non-stop racket of, for example, The Yellow Cake Revue (1980), played at top volume
  in the vicinity of the pond, will soon have your swan seeking shelter. By angling
  the loudspeakers correctly, you can make your living room the haven the poor panic-stricken
  swan yearns for.

  You will of course need to keep the music piping across the pond until such time
  as the government announces an all-clear, but that is the least of your worries.
  The important thing is that your swan will be safe.

  GLUTEN-FREE JABBERING MAN

  I am Gluten-Free Jabbering Man, and I jabber in the corridors of power. Like a L''Oreal
  product, I am armed with light-reflecting booster technology. I use it wisely, and
  do not abuse the advantages it gives me. How easy it would be for me to take a Member
  of Parliament, like Lembit Opik, say, or Dawn Primarolo, and not only boost the
  light reflecting off them but jabber at them until they, too, are gluten-free. I
  could if I wished do the same with captains of industry, media moguls, big players
  in the world of sport, with anyone you care to mention who has even the tiniest
  smidgeon of power and influence in the world. I have often been tempted to wreak
  my weird magic on Lionel Richie, for example, and yet I restrain myself. Now, I
  just do the jabbering, a quiet sort of jabbering, and I jabber only at the little
  bugs and creepy-crawlies that scurry unnoticed in the corridors of power, unnoticed,
  that is, by all but me, and by the pest controllers, to whom I refrain from jabbering,
  for even with my light-reflecting booster technology I suspect they would outwit
  me with their fearsome engines of destruction, their sprays and rays and fumes and
  beams. I covet such weaponry, but it would be too dangerous in my hands, and in
  any case, I am the personification of mercy, and I am replete.


  "I AM A BUTTERCUP GOLDEN AND FREE..."

  "I am a buttercup golden and free standing in a field of flame... strange and hideous
  beasts wander through the fire and I want to be a rose" -- Erin Millar, A Buttercup
  In A Field Of Flame


  IDENTIFICATION WITH BUTTERCUPS

  Today''s quotation is taken from one of the many splendid poems on the Teen Angst
  website. This is a collection of magnificently intense verse "contributed by people
  eighteen and over who have overcome their angst and are able to laugh at their past
  (and the products of their angst)". I chose Erin Millar''s piece because I, too,
  have often identified myself with the buttercup. Here is an extract from an interview
  I gave some years ago:

  Interviewer--So then, Frank, if you were a flower of the field, what flower of the
  field would you be?

  Frank--I would be a buttercup.

  Interviewer--Are you saying that you would like to poison cows, or at least cause
  cows indigestion or other mild gastric ailments?

  Frank--Sometimes, yes, if the weight of the world hangs heavy on my shoulders and
  I lose all sense of moral purpose, that would be true, regrettably.

  Interviewer--I commend you for the brutal honesty of your reply, Frank, but you
  do realise that I could turn you over to the police as a potential danger to cows?

  Frank--Crikey! I hadn''t thought of that!

  Interviewer--Is there any particular type of buttercup you particularly identify
  with?

  Frank--Yes, there is. I would be happiest, I think, as a celeryleaf buttercup, because
  it is also known as cursed crowfoot.

  Interviewer--Well, that''s all we have time for. Thanks, Frank. [Turns to camera]
  If there are any cows watching, don''t have nightmares. Frank isn''t really a buttercup,
  and he''s not going to come and poison you.


  CUSTARD

  Today, my thoughts turn to custard. I do not mean by this that my brain is curdling
  into mush, though that may well happen as the day goes on. This is, after all, early
  21st century Britain, and I am assailed by twaddle and pap wherever I look. It would
  not be surprising if I succumbed to it and began to gibber and drool.

  That is why I have concentrated my mind on custard. Let us recall the words of Ned
  Ward (1667-1731), who wrote "Custard, that noble cooling Food, / So toothsome, wholesome
  and so good, / That Dainty so approv''d of old, / Whose yellow surface shines like
  Gold". Ward was a poet and a publican, described as follows in Volume IX of the
  first edition of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature: "He was
  no wizard, but a pedestrian jogtrot writer of doggerel, whom criticism could not
  affright nor opposition baulk. Yet his Hudibras is a wonderful achievement. Its
  facile fluent ease marks the versifier who could write two hundred lines standing
  on one foot. His language is common enough. Neither Brown nor Motteux surpasses
  him in knowledge of the slang which was heard in the tavern or at the street corner.
  Had he lived today, he might have been an ornament of the sporting press. Living
  when he did, he supported the cause of church and state in such couplets as jingled
  in the brain, and tripped readily to the tongue."


  Ned Ward

  The custard-soaked quotation is from Ward''s British Wonders : Or, A Poetical Description
  of the Several Prodigies and Most Remarkable Accidents That have happen''d in Britain
  since the Death of Queen Anne (1717). (Incidentally, do you lament, as I do, the
  passing of long, even unwieldy book-titles? Nowadays everything has to be snappy
  and memorable, presumably so it can be marketed by zonk-eyed bean-counters. If someone
  published a history of ink today, it would no doubt be called Ink!, with the obligatory
  subtitle The Liquid That Changed The World. When David N Carvalho addressed the
  topic in 1904, his book had the majestic title Forty Centuries Of Ink, Or A Chronological
  Narrative Concerning Ink And Its Backgrounds, Introducing Incidental Observations
  And Deductions, Parallels Of Time And Colour Phenomena, Bibliography, Chemistry,
  Poetical Effusions, Citations, Anecdotes And Curiosa Together With Some Evidence
  Respecting The Evanescent Character Of Most Inks Of Today And An Epitome Of Chemico-Legal
  Ink. Ah, those were the days.)

  Ink, custard. Could custard ever be called The Yellow Goo That Changed the World?
  Possibly not. It is difficult to think of any earth-shattering events in which custard
  has played a pivotal role, or indeed any role at all. I know that I could make some
  up, if I so desired, but I am not going to, not today anyway, for today it seems
  important to cleave to the truth.

  What is custard, anyway? According to the wikipedia, it is a family of preparations
  based on milk and eggs, thickened with heat. Most commonly, it refers to a dessert
  or dessert sauce, but custard bases are also used for quiches and other savoury
  foods. Depending on how much egg or thickener is used, custard may vary in consistency
  from a thin pouring sauce to a thick blancmange. Most custard is cooked in a double
  boiler (bain-marie) or heated very gently on the stove in a saucepan, but custard
  can also be steamed or baked in the oven with or without a hot water bath. Instant
  and ready-made ''custards'' are also marketed, though they are not true custards
  if they are not thickened with egg. I think we can agree that only true custard
  is worthy of our attention, particularly on this day devoted to truth.

  Readers may wonder why, today of all days, I am so insistent on truth-telling. My
  reasons, I should say, are entirely non-custard-related. Exactly forty eight years
  ago, on the sixth of February 1958, the Busby Babes--the flower of post-war British
  football--were wiped out in the Munich Air Disaster. Hang your head in their memory
  for a moment before continuing to read.


  The Busby Babes boarding the fatal aeroplane

  Oh, come on, hang your head a bit longer than that!

  I have never cared a jot about football myself, but my Uncle Ned was a fierce adherent
  of the sport. (Ned was not named after Ned Ward, by the way, in case you were wondering.)
  Deeply affected by the tragedy that unfolded at that blizzard-wracked German airfield,
  Ned cajoled our whole extended family into joining him in his annual remembrance
  of the crash. Throughout my childhood--throughout my life--the sixth of February
  has been the most significant day of the year. It means more to me than Christmas,
  or Easter, or even my birthday. I can blithely let feast days and holy days pass
  unremarked. You will find me unmoved on National Potato Day (29th January), Penguin
  Awareness Day (20th January) and National Punctuation Day (24th September). Yet
  the shade of dead Uncle Ned hovers over me on this day, and perhaps it is in homage
  to him, rather than to those lost young footballers, that I promise to speak only
  the truth, from midnight to midnight.


  Thomas More

  And that is why I write only of true custard, not of the wretched synthetic slop
  that seeks to deceive the custard-innocent palate. We would do well to remember
  here that Thomas More''s wife (or was it his daughter?) took custards to him when
  he was imprisoned by King Henry VIII. Those would have been true custards, without
  a doubt. Admittedly, my source is semi-fictional, being an ill-remembered reading
  of Robert Bolt''s play A Man For All Seasons. What is clear in my memory is that
  this was my first encounter with the construction "a custard", as opposed to "some
  custard" or "a bowl of custard" or, of course, simply "custard". I was about fourteen
  years old at the time, given the play to read as part of my schoolwork, and all
  I recall of it is the curious fascination I felt for that indefinite article. "A
  custard"! It was so unexpected, it made me think of custard in a new way. I tried
  to visualise what this centuries-old custard would have looked like. If it was not
  in a bowl or a dish, it must have some solid form. Was it wrapped up in a bag, a
  bag of wool or burlap? Years passed before I learned that the very word "custard"
  is derived from "crustade" which is a tart with a crust. So doomed Thomas More''s
  custards would have been encased in pastry, I surmise.


  Pierre Bonnard

  One final note, not exactly about custard, but about yellow, the colour of custard.
  However pale it may be, true custard has at least a yellow tinge. The French painter
  Pierre Bonnard once remarked "Ah, yellow! I can''t get enough of it!" Readers, can
  you say the same for custard?'
