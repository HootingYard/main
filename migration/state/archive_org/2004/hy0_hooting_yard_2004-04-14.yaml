  Mister Bim bought an atlas as a birthday gift for his daughter, who was tremendously
  fond of geography. Without opening the big fat book, Mister Bim asked the oddly-haired
  shop assistant to wrap it up in colourful and exciting paper and to tie a ribbon
  around it. The shop assistant did the wrapping with precision and care, but then
  got the ribbon entangled in his odd hair, and had to use a pair of scissors to free
  it. Now the ribbon was not long enough to girdle the atlas.

  "I am most dreadfully dreadfully sorry," said the shop assistant.

  "Oh never you mind now," said Mister Bim, "the wrapping paper is lovely all by itself."
  The paper had a pattern of interlocking hollyhocks, delphiniums, and fire extinguishers,
  all red and green and gold and purple and yellow and blue.

  Mister Bim''s daughter, Clytemnestra, unwrapped the atlas on her birthday three
  days later. She beamed and gave her papa a kiss on his hairy cheek.

  "Oh gosh what can I say thank you so much papa!" she said.

  We learned in the very first sentence that Clytemnestra was terrifically fond of
  geography. That fondness had led her to become knowledgeable, too. So imagine her
  disappointment when, upon close inspection, she discovered that every single one
  of the maps in the atlas was inaccurate. The port of Split is not in Bolivia. The
  world''s largest lake is not just a few miles south of Swanage. Swanage itself is
  not spelled Swange.

  "I will take it back to that shop and complain," said Mister Bim.

  "No no, papa. Let us tear all the maps out of the book and make a fire with them.
  Let us create a conflagration like unto the very flames of Hell."

  And, children, do you know something? That is exactly what they did!

  TODAY''S RECIPE

  Ingredients : 6 oz self-raising flour, 6 oz self-hatred flour, 4 tbsp Jezebel oil,
  25 pints boiled duckpond water, 1 raisin, 12 quail''s eggs, a smidgeon of marzipan,
  12 cucumbers, 13 sticks rhubarb, a very large hollyhock, 2 buckets chaff, 1 pint
  turtle''s blood, 5 pkts Special K(r), 15 blood oranges, 2 fresh bream*, 54 more
  raisins, 1 plastic bag, 8 radishes, 1 cup ble, 18 pints milk, 3 lb toffee, 5 tbsp
  gum arabic, 2 cups Bathsheba extract, 62 moorhen feathers, dash of isinglass, 1
  tbsp lemon curd, 3 balls wool, 5 oz. titanium, 1 beetle, 8 jars nameless, eldritch
  plasma.

  Method : 1. Find a large metal drum, about the size of a telephone kiosk. 2. Shove
  everything into it, having chopped up the things that need chopping. 3. Boil. 4.
  While it boils, think long and hard about the fact that rhubarb takes its name from
  the Greek rheon barbaron, that is, something which comes from the barbarous country
  of the Rha--the Greek name for the Volga. 5. When it has finished boiling, transfer
  it into a big metal basin and bake it in an oven for four hours. 6. Remove from
  oven, allow to cool, then cut into cake-size cubes. 7. Fry the cakes over a low
  flame until golden, or what passes for golden in this leaden age. 8. Serve with
  milk diluted with tap water.

  * NOTE : The bream is the only fish to be named after a major 20th century English
  lutenist.


  DARK STAR CRASHES

  Pouring its light into ashes. Reason tatters. These are weighty matters. So weighty,
  indeed, that you must note them in your jotter. But--horror of horrors!--with what
  will you jot? You recall with a pang that your biro is lost, or perhaps has been
  purloined by the Biro Thief, he whose exploits have so enthralled the readers of
  the Daily Clang. Your drawer, of course, is innocent of pencils. It has been so
  since childhood. Your papa would have no pencils in his house, you recall, and yet
  he never revealed the wellspring of his loathing. Once, you tried to write about
  it--with your biro--and your book His Loathing: Its Wellspring was, well ... well-received
  up to a point, though there were those who said it lacked a certain dash. To your
  shame, you blamed your papa''s chlamydia, a conclusion so preposterous that your
  uncle sued you in a court of law. Behind the door of the court of law lurked a lactose-intolerant
  nitroglycerine boffin, a bluestocking who became your wife and changed your life.
  You pulped all copies of your book and sat in steam. You had a hideous headache
  for a week. But planning, as you did, to raise no storms, you kept all pencils from
  your house, just as your father did. Your wife asked why--you used a nib to jot
  down your reply. I am my father''s son, you wrote, He died a pauper. He was that
  kind of guy.


  A GUIDE TO POINTY TOWN : PART TWO

  Yesterday we listed some of the things Pointy Town is famous for. Yet it is no Utopia.
  For instance, you will find in the town no trace whatsoever of quaintness, wry euphonium
  rehearsals, toffee, yoghurt, ululating idiots, ornithological paraphernalia, athletics,
  sawdust, dockyard flamboyance, gutters, hedgerows, jugglers, kissing lovers, zealous
  x-ray-eyed cadets, & "Visigoth"-brand nougat munchies. But who needs any of those
  things when there are great architectural marvels to be seen? One of the most striking
  and gigantic buildings in Pointy Town is the Old Wretched Flophouse. The principal
  front on the land side is considerably more than one-third of a Javan mile in length,
  and its wings, in depth, extend six hundred and seventy two feet, down to the edge
  of the Big Frightening River, this noble watercourse forming the fourth side of
  the quadrangle. Within the three sides (the Big Frightening River and two wings)
  are ranges of parallel buildings, which form the magazines, artificers'' shops,
  mast and boat houses, offices, &c.; and in the area within these are four slips
  for building the largest, and two for the smaller class of Tugboats of Pointlessness.
  The whole of the outer range of buildings consists of lamentable suites of rooms,
  and long and filthily ornamented galleries, filled with the natural history and
  curiosities collected in every part of the globe, and brought by the different navigators
  which Pointy Town, of late years, has sent forth on discovery. In one room are assembled
  all the different nautical and mathematical instruments; in another all the models
  of toy brazil nuts of different nations and different eras; in another a complete
  library connected with every branch of both human and inhuman knowledge. The library''s
  most treasured item is the manuscript of the first draft of Sepulveda''s inane Lines
  Written Upon First Listening To ''Dr Bogenbroom'' by Jethro Tull.


  TRANSCRIPT OF A DICTAPHONE RECORDING

  [Uncanny and repetitive metallic banging noises, as if from the maw of Hell.]

  Ick Ack Ulm. According to the programme, this racket must be an ensemble called
  "Brouhaha" playing a piece called Tiny moths, ah! gossamer wings. I suppose that''s
  meant to be ironic in some way. Either that or it''s a mistranslation--after all,
  they''re Hungarians. And so many of them! I counted forty, but then more appeared
  with hammers and other ironmongery. And they all bear a faint resemblance to Abraham
  Lincoln. Maybe "Brouhaha" is one big family. I will have to check. This piece has
  been going on for over an hour and they look as if they''re just warming up. God
  help us.

  [Edit.]

  Now that was more like it. I''ve just finished watching Fleur & Primrose, much more
  conducive to my tastes. Fleur played pocket cornet and Primrose played tack piano.
  Instrumentals, mostly, with a sort of valiant carelessness. I don''t think any of
  the pieces lasted more than 45 seconds. The last number was strange. They were joined
  by someone called Dennis, who shouted things. I think he was reading from a list
  of water polo cup tie results. Matchless!

  [Edit.]

  I really don''t know what I''m doing here.

  [Edit.]

  It''s three hours since I last recorded. I''ve just come back on the bus from the
  Ulm Swimming Pool, Lido and Marina complex, where parts of the Festival are taking
  place. I went over there to hear the big event everyone has been talking about--the
  premiere of Binder''s Concerto For Medicine Balls, Blood Oranges & Canoe. I assumed
  it was going to be an electronic piece, but no, it was all natural, unamplified
  sound, and somehow it had an astonishing Monteverdiesque resonance which is hard
  to explain. It was visually exciting too, as all the players were wearing hideous
  orange jump-suits. I''m sure I saw Primrose in the melee somewhere, without her
  tack piano sadly.

  [Edit.]

  Next up is something called "Big Flugelhorn Mayhem In The Northern Territories Disputed
  By Goat Boy And His Whelk Farm Hard Hat Orchestra". I think I''ll give it a miss.

  [Recording ends.]


  WORLD O'' CAKE

  Following the item about the sop to Cerberus (see below, January 24th January),
  reader Ruth Pastry has written as follows: "It is all very well including such nuggets
  of (questionable) information, but if you are going to whet the readers'' appetite
  in such a manner, please do not stint* when it comes to giving us the full story.
  I am sure I am not alone in wanting to know what kind of cake is referred to. Chocolate
  swiss roll? Battenburg? Old Mother Framley''s Cherry Surprise?"

  Point taken, Dr Pastry. If any readers can help out, I will be happy to publish
  contributions to this invigorating debate.

  *NOTE : A stint is, of course, a bird. What is Dr Pastry prattling on about?


  "THE KAM, AS IF APPROACHING THE YARTA..."

  "The kam, as if approaching the Yarta of Erlik and coming into his presence, bows,
  brings his drum up to his forehead, and says, ''Mergu! mergu!'' Then he declares
  whence and why he comes. Suddenly he shouts; this is meant to indicate that Erlik
  is angry that a mortal should dare to enter his yurta. The frightened kam leaps
  backward towards the door, but gathers fresh courage and again approaches Erlik''s
  throne. After this performance has been gone through three times, Erlik speaks:
  ''Winged creatures cannot fly hither, beings with bones cannot come: how have you,
  ill-smelling black beetle, made your way to my abode?''" -- M. A. Czaplicka, Shamanism
  In Siberia'
