full_text: 'JFK : THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS


  Today being the forty-first anniversary of the assassination of Potus John Fitzgerald
  Kennedy, it is appropriate to pose some of the questions about that day in Dallas
  which remain unanswered. Perhaps they are unanswerable.

  Did the citizens of Dallas refer to the grassy knoll as "the grassy knoll" before
  it became known as The Grassy Knoll, or did they call it "a grassy knoll" or "that
  grassy knoll", or even "that patch of grass over there in Dealey Plaza"? Similarly,
  was the white picket fence known as "that white picket fence" or just "that fence"?

  Did his family, friends and acquaintances address Umbrella Man as "umbrella man"
  prior to 22nd November 1963? The same question can be asked of Badge Man, and indeed
  of Marymoon Man, or, as some commentators on the assassination have it, Mary Moonman,
  or Moorman.

  We know that future Potus Richard Milhous Nixon flew out of Dallas, suspiciously,
  on the morning of the assassination. Was he accompanied by his dog Checkers, or
  had Checkers already passed to The Other Side by then?

  Elderly dressmaker Abraham Zapruder famously shot the Zapruder Footage on that sunny
  November day in Dallas. Who decided to dub it "The Zapruder Footage" as opposed
  to, say, "The Zapruder Film" or "Zapruder''s cinefilm"?

  The cinema in which Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended was showing the film War Is
  Hell starring Van Heflin at the time. Was Mr Heflin part of the conspiracy, if indeed
  there was a conspiracy?


  Brain guru Tony Buzan : was he in the Texas Schoolbook Depository?

  A question with wider implications relates to the practice of assassin nomenclature.
  When was it decided, and by whom, that the assassins of Potuses (or Potae) should
  invariably be given their full three names, as in Lee Harvey Oswald and John Wilkes
  Booth? Why is this also accorded to the assassins of whining Liverpudlian pop singers
  (Mark David Chapman) but not to unsuccessful Potus assassins (John Hinckley) unless
  they are members of the Manson cult (Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme)? And is Sirhan Sirhan''s
  middle name also Sirhan?


  BUILD YOUR OWN PLASTICINE MODEL OF DEALEY PLAZA

  Continuing with the JFK theme, here is a craft project devised by Fatima Gilliblat:

  First, get some plasticine. Before opening the package, wash your hands thoroughly
  in warm water. If your hands are really grubby, for instance if you have been doing
  grubby things, use swarfega. I am making no moral judgement on your indulgence in
  grubby practices, merely noting that warm water by itself will not suffice to cleanse
  the pollution from your fleshly extremities. As for your immortal soul, far be it
  from me to pronounce upon the peril in which it is placed by your unconscionable
  grubbiness. After all, I am no saint. That being said, I abhor the kind of grubbiness
  to which you may have fallen prey, albeit that I do not make it my business to go
  about declaring my own rectitude, as that would be boastful. Once or twice, maybe,
  I have dipped my toe in the slimy puddle of moral turpitude, and that was quite
  enough for me.

  Now to the second stage of this exciting project. With your prayer book or catechism
  resting upon the work surface in easy reach, open the packet of plasticine. Intone
  three Hail Marys, break off some plasticine, and begin to mould it into the shape
  of the grassy knoll. It is advisable at this point to go and fetch your rosary beads.

  Before completing the grassy knoll part of the model, open up that tin of swarfega
  and clean your hands again. You can never be too careful.

  When you have made a passable model of the grassy knoll, take some matchsticks and
  press them into the plasticine to represent the white picket fence. Say a novena.
  Now grab another chunk of plasticine and fashion a miniature version of the Texas
  Schoolbook Depository. Remember to tweak a tiny tubular shape poking out of the
  sixth floor window to show assassin Lee Harvey Oswald''s mail order Mannlicher Carcano
  rifle with which he shot the Potus, allegedly.

  A pink blob of plasticine will do for Jackie Kennedy''s pillbox hat.

  The underpass over the Stemmons Freeway is quite tricky to make out of plasticine,
  so you may wish to use a few bits of cardboard. Your local supermarket probably
  has packaging and boxes piled up somewhere for customers to take away. Go and get
  sufficient boxes to cut enough cardboard for the underpass, and while you are out
  and about, drop into your nearest Catholic church and make your confession to Father
  O''Flaherty. If your priest has a different name, don''t worry. If you don''t have
  a priest, do worry, for you will burn in hell, however skilfully you manage to complete
  your plasticine and cardboard model of Dealey Plaza.

  When you return home, your soul now washed clean of all disgusting vileness, put
  the finishing touches to your model by curving a rectangle of plasticine into the
  shape of the pergola from where the Zapruder footage was shot. If you have exhausted
  your tin of swarfega, plunge your hands into a basin of piping hot soapy water while
  contemplating the martyrdom of your favourite saint.

  Place your toy Dealey Plaza in a suitable location, for example, the mantelpiece,
  display cabinet, or kitchen table. Next time Father O''Flaherty visits, ask him
  to sprinkle some holy water on it. He will be happy to oblige, I am sure.


  BEWARE OF OVEREXCITEMENT!

  The nights are drawing in and soon winter will be upon us. Remember the long-ago
  days when people made their own entertainment? Ho what fun was to be had! Here are
  two completely genuine items from Frederica Seeger''s Entertainments For Home, Church
  & School (1910). Still thy beating heart!

  BUTTON, BUTTON The players sit around the room in a circle. The leader then holds
  a button between his hands, with the palms pressed together, so as to hide it. He
  goes around the circle, passing his hand between those of the players. As he does
  this, he says: "Hold fast to what I give you." He is careful not to let the players
  see into whose hands he passed the button. The circuit having been made, the leader
  says to the first player: "Button, button, who has the button?" The one questioned
  must answer, naming some one whom he thinks has it. So it continues until all have
  had a turn at answering the same question. Then the leader says: "Button, button,
  rise!" The button holder must do this.


  Some buttons

  PROGRESSIVE PUZZLES Provide as many small, square cards as there are guests; also
  several pairs of scissors. The party seats itself in a circle. The cards and scissors
  are given out. Then each player cuts his card twice across, so as to make four pieces.
  The straight cuts must intersect each other. After the first cut, the pieces must
  be held together until the second cut has been made. A player mixes his pieces and
  passes them to his right-hand neighbor. When the leader gives the signal, all the
  players put together the four pieces they have. The one who first succeeds calls
  out "ready." Then all stop and pass the cards on again. The successful player is
  given a mark on a tally card. The game goes on until a half hour has passed. The
  person receiving the most marks is entitled to a prize, or may become the leader,
  as preferred.


  THE HORRIBLE CAVE : PART THREE

  Along with Blenkinsop and De Groot, Pabstus was the man who brought rigour to the
  study of animals'' bones back in the fifties. I wondered what he was doing wandering
  disconsolately around the garden of a Bewilderment Home, for that is where I assumed
  I had been plunked. Before I had a chance to ask him, he began to jabber questions
  at me about the horrible cave. After fifteen or so queries, all of which I answered
  as best as I could, Pabstus changed tack and asked me why I was dressed as a giant
  bee. For my part, let me say it had not escaped my notice that the world-famous
  irredentist was clad in raiment of the utmost gorgeousness.

  We seemed to have struck an instant rapport, so we strolled off together towards
  a nearby pie shop which, Pabstus informed me, he had eaten at every single day for
  the last thirty years. When we entered the place, I pondered his judgment, for the
  floor was alive with scurrying beetles, huge black terrible things, and the air
  was thick with the smell of hamster. Seeing me about to swoon, Pabstus grinned,
  and I saw that his mouth was packed with fangs. There seemed to be too many of them
  to fit, but my eyes did not deceive me.

  "You have an alarming number of teeth, Pabstus," I observed.

  "No more than any other member of my extended family," he replied, tapping a bell
  upon the counter to summon the pie shop person. I have had a long and full life,
  but never before had I heard so dreadful a sound as that bell. I clapped my hands
  over my ears and began to weep like a distressed orphan child. Pabstus saw my discomfort
  and bared his fangs at me again. The hideous Beelzebubesque bell-pealing faded,
  but only once the sound had died completely did the proprietor appear. I had expected
  some sort of jolly figure like Mister Dough The Baker from a deck of Happy Families
  playing cards, but the pie shop person looked and acted more like a fop of the Regency
  period. He even wore gloves scented with lavender. With a rakish twinkle in his
  eye, he greeted us, and somehow made the words "Good afternoon, would you like to
  buy some pies?" sound lascivious.

  "Yes we would!" shouted Pabstus at top volume, "For myself, I want to buy one of
  your big crinkle-pastry dumpling and endive and chicory pies, and two small mustard
  balls. My colleague here will have..." and he trailed off, inviting me to complete
  our request. Not having been to this pie shop before, I had no idea what I should
  choose, and there seemed to be no menu visible. But I sensed inexplicable danger,
  and wanted to get out of here as soon as I could. "I''ll have the same," I announced,
  weakly.

  "That won''t be possible I''m afraid," said the pie-fop, "As you must surely know,
  today is Saint Eustace''s Day."

  I did not have the energy to argue. Perhaps that blow on the head which found me
  slumped in an unfamiliar armchair and suffering from amnesia had taken more of a
  toll than I thought. I pointed to two celery pies on a shelf behind the counter
  and asked for them. The proprietor preened his locks with macassar oil, and said,
  "Those pies are for rental only."

  Beetles were now climbing up the legs of my borrowed bee-like boiler suit. I could
  stand no more of this. I turned and left the pie shop, slamming the door behind
  me. I decided that I would rather go hungry than allow myself to fall under Pabstus''
  spell. It was a decision I would learn to regret.

  Assuming the limping irredentist would pursue me as soon as he had got his hands
  on his pies, I flung myself into a ditch and covered myself with a flag that happened
  to be lying about. I was surprised that the flag had been abandoned, for it looked
  as if it had been stitched only recently, and there was still a needle attached
  to a dangling piece of thread. I accidentally prodded myself with the needle, in
  the general area of my right collarbone, and had to stifle a yelp in case Pabstus
  was already on my trail.

  Crouched under a flag in a ditch in the early afternoon, I turned my thoughts once
  more to the horrible cave, and to the crows that nested therein. It was a long,
  long time since I had been perturbed by birds, so long ago that I had difficulty
  remembering much about the days when my parents'' toffee shop had been attacked
  by flocks of mutant sparrows and wagtails. But the malevolence of the crows I had
  seen near the horrible cave was unprecedented. Tippi Hedren had an easy time of
  it by comparison, I reflected ruefully, for I am given to rueful reflection, especially
  when I can feel silage seeping into my boots, as I could now. Could I risk standing
  up? I knew that if I maintained my crouch for much longer I would suffer from agonising
  cramps, and I had left my cramp medication in the breast pocket of my pyjama jacket,
  back at the nursing home or whatever it was. I wondered if I could flee from the
  ditch and make it to the building without being waylaid by Pabstus. All of a sudden
  that stuffy lounge with its creaking armchair, and Primrose the nurse with her mashed
  potatoes, even the rake-thin ghoul, seemed more attractive than this stinking ditch.

  Crawling out from under the flag, I peered over the lip of the ditch to check that
  Pabstus was no longer in the vicinity. He was not. Perhaps he had taken his pies
  and was sitting on a park bench, masticating them with those fangs of his, swallowing
  every last crumb. I clambered up and was about to stalk off towards the mercy home
  when I thought the flag might come in handy, so I stooped to pick it out of the
  ditch. It was heavier than I thought, but eventually I had it wrapped around me.
  As I turned to go, I saw that now my way was blocked by thousands of cows, all of
  them gazing at me intently, as if I were something they might want to chew up and
  digest. Were they cows, or were they super-intelligent beings from a planet in a
  distant galaxy who looked like earth-cows? Within the next few minutes, I would
  learn the truth, a truth far more incredible than my puny brain could comprehend.


  HOMAGE TO ESTHER AND ABI OFARIM


  Here is an extract from Dobson''s private journal, dated 20th November 1969:

  For the past few weeks I have become increasingly fixated upon the young Israeli
  singing duo Esther and Abi Ofarim. Yesterday I dug out a reel-to-reel tape recording
  device from a jumble of abandoned equipment in the broom cupboard and made a looping
  tape, or tape loop, I think it''s called, of the pair performing Lord Of The Reedy
  River. This is my favourite of their waxings, perhaps because in my dreams I like
  to think that I could one day be a lord or tsar or baron or potentate of a reedy
  river, a very reedy river, a river so choked with reeds and weeds and thin stringy
  green flora that the water is brackish and its surface covered in scum. One imagines
  the smell of this river being quite unbearable, and it being shunned even by dogs.

  The song appears on last year''s long player Up To Date, copies of which I think
  I will give out as Christmas presents this year, whether the recipients want it
  or not. I am toying with the idea of founding an Esther & Abi Fan Club, although
  I suspect one already exists. Of course, Lord Of The Reedy River is only one of
  their great tracks. I have become convinced that if music has a future, these personable
  youngsters are the key to it.

  Another terrific thing about them is that so many anagrams can be made from "Esther
  And Abi Ofarim", including "fat horse brain media", "mashed airborne fiat", "bear
  firm, oh Satan, die!", "Moira''s refined a bath", "oh! train beside a farm", "bards
  in fire at a home", "for Theda Bara is mine", "hamster foe in bad air", and "a basin
  of mired earth". I think that last one would make a great title for their next album,
  so if I can find out how to contact them I am going to write and suggest it.

  I suppose I ought to mention that Ms Chew says their music is driving her crackers,
  and she has decamped to a seaside resort, even though it is November and the weather
  is exceedingly inclement. She has not even told me to which confounded pebbly shore
  she has gone, so I am quite bereft, and only the dulcet tones of Esther and Abi
  singing Lord Of The Reedy River, and indeed Sanie Cu Zurgalai, Purple Eyes, and
  Ack Varmeland, Du Skona are keeping me from flinging myself off a parapet, as my
  grandfather did when he could no longer cope with his aversion to breakfast cereals,
  a tragic episode told in full in my pamphlet Cornflakes, Ready Brek, Special K and
  Suicide, which I am sad to note is now out of print.


  WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE

  From the archives:

  When push comes to shove, I invariably topple over. If I am standing on a precipice,
  or at the edge of a gaping pit, this can be life-threatening. Thus, whenever my
  plans for the day include roaming in the vicinity of a yawning chasm, I take precautions
  by wearing a sort of winch-and-pulley affair, one end of which is wound around my
  torso, under my vest, and the other end of which I hammer into a patch of firm ground
  using a great big iron mallet. I am careful to ensure that this end of my winch-and-pulley
  is stuck fast in the earth, for if there is any chance of it working itself loose,
  the entire activity would be pointless, for if, heaven forbid, I were to topple
  when shoved, my efforts would have been in vain, for the crumbling or squelchy soil
  would yield up my winch-and-pulley and I would surely topple as if I had never been
  attached to anything in the first place. That is such a terrible prospect that I
  make efforts to map out in advance the terrain in which I plan to wander, perhaps
  a week or so ahead. Of course, fugitive weather conditions can alter the state of
  the ground as shown on my charts, but risk and chance play a role in all human affairs,
  and there is no reason why my roamings should be exempt. When setting out on my
  map-making expeditions, I usually attach one end of the winch-and-pulley to some
  stable object like a horse-trough or a concrete sundial.

  My benefactors have long sought to deter me from straying near pits, chasms and
  abandoned mineshafts, so I am afraid I have had to use subterfuge. As I wave to
  them from the garden gate, with the winch-and-pulley concealed behind a muffler,
  I say something like, "I am just going out to check the concrete sundial" or "My
  my, the day is so clement that I think I will stroll along a flat and featureless
  plain like the big field where Farmer Buzan used to grow his potatoes all those
  years ago". Sometimes such announcements will be met with questions, which I am
  usually able to anticipate by peering at the furrowedness of my benefactors'' brows.
  At other times I may have to improvise a convincing response or deflect the queries
  by pointing at a starling, for example, or forcing a sudden spray of projectile
  vomiting. When push comes to shove, pointing at a starling is my preferred option.

  It is twenty years now since I bashed in Farmer Buzan''s head with his own spade.
  I like to think that my benefactors trust me these days, but it seems not. Oh look,
  there''s a starling in that sycamore tree!'
