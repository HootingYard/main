  Today it is of decisive importance that I tell you about Blodgettesque farming methods.
  The techniques pioneered by Blodgett in his heyday are breathtaking. Consider, for
  example, the uses to which a Blodgettian farmer will put hay. There are many, many
  diagrams in the manual which show bales of hay being commandeered for all sorts
  of inventive purposes, all over the farmyard, in all six seasons of the year. That''s
  right, six seasons. One of Blodgett''s most telling innovations was his calendrical
  recalibration, if I am using the word correctly. Out go winter, spring, summer and
  autumn, or fall, as they say in Pining & Pothorst Land; in come tally, spate, the
  time of mighty remonstrations, tack, hub and bolismus. So, come hub come the haywain,
  as the saying goes, with his big fat boots stuffed with straw... I mean hay.

  We ought not get diverted from this important essay by wandering down the byways
  of Blodgettian countryside parlance, but I cannot resist sharing with you the rhyme
  that goes Don''t forget to shut the gate / On the forty-third of spate, the meaning
  of which is obvious, as you would realise had you seen, as I have, an implacable
  army of albino hens marching off into the sunset because little Vercingetorix the
  barnyard hobbledehoy was too busy chewing on a sheaf of fronds to remember to close
  the gate behind him. As it happened, the fronds were poisonous, and the miscreant
  was subject to convulsive fits for the next three weeks, bless him.

  As with hay, so with mulch. Blodgettesque mulch is a thing of beauty, even if it
  does stink. Have you ever seen asparagus grown in Blodgett''s mulch? You would remember
  if you had, for it is to common everyday asparagus as a big shiny supersonic 26th
  century space rocket is to a shred of plankton. Preparation of mulch takes place
  mostly in bolismus, when the winds howl and thunderclaps shatter the eardrums of
  toiling farm workers, hardy folk with almost inhuman musculature as a result of
  regular doses of Blodgett''s serum, the recipe for which appears in an appendix
  to the manual.

  To begin farming the Blodgett way, all you will need is a hoe, a shapeless hat,
  iron determination, and your own field, preferably one with a pond in it, and ducks
  in the pond, mergansers or teal, some of them real, some of them wood-carved decoy
  ducks, and some of them just vaporous spectres of your own imagining.


  THE LIFE AND LOVES OF MRS GUBBINS

  Readers will recall that the octogenarian crone Mrs Gubbins has returned to her
  duties running various important aspects of the Hooting Yard empire. After being
  on the run from the police and gaining sanctuary with the Tundists for a few months,
  she seems revitalised, and in among everything else she is writing her autobiography.
  I crept into her office the other day and stole a few pages of the manuscript, extracts
  of which will appear here from time to time.

  After my divorce from the man who liked to sing Shenandoah morning noon and night,
  setting my teeth on edge, I became a flapper and spent the next five years going
  from one party to another. I doubt that any of the demimondaines I canoodled with
  had any idea that, between parties, I was lecturing at various colleges on the history
  of bell-ringing and the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Tudor church. It was
  through this shared interest that I met Ah-Fang, who became husband number two.

  "Bathsheba," he would say to me, "I often wonder why my parents named me Ah-Fang.
  After all, my father was Belgian and my mother hailed from the tenebrous, dense
  forests of northern Finland. My siblings all have names like Jan and Joost and Hakki
  and Einojuhani."

  "How many siblings have you got, Ah-Fang my sweet?" I would ask, pecking him on
  the cheek. Then his brow would grow furrowed and he would become morose and mutter
  something about going out to buy a bottle of dandelion and burdock. I became unhappy
  at this secretiveness of his, and it grieves me to think that during our eight months
  together I felt closer to my pet anteater, Desmondo. Nonetheless, I wept for a week
  when Ah-Fang perished in the Hindenburg disaster. I owe my life to the fact that
  for once I was not at his side, having that very week been employed to spy on the
  young Anthony Burgess, or John Wilson as he then was, for reasons I forget. I must
  say it rains a lot in Lancashire.

  Next episode : Mrs Gubbins goes to war


  The Hindenburg disaster of 1937

  BEAN DISEASES!

  A new play by Dennis Cargpan

  Scene I

  Enter Trimulchio and Vincenzo, Duke of Squallorca

  Trimulchio : The principal disease affecting beans is a form of anthracnose caused
  by a fungus that attacks the stems, leaves, and pods of the bean. It is most visible
  on pods, in which it causes deep, dark pits.

  Vincenzo : Fie, sirrah! To prevent the disease, seeds are carefully selected, and
  care is taken not to spread the fungus from one plant to another during wet weather.

  Exeunt

  Scene II

  Enter Bostinza, a fop

  Bostinza : A type of rust may defoliate bean plants. It first appears as small brown
  dots containing a brown powder, the spores of the fungus.

  Scene III

  Enter Trimulchio

  Trimulchio : Forsooth! Later the spots become larger and the spores black.

  Exeunt, covered in beans.

  MORE ABOUT AH-FANG

  We learned on Thursday that Mrs Gubbins'' second husband, Ah-Fang Van Der Houygendorp,
  died in the Hindenburg Disaster (see 30th September). The brief paragraphs from
  her autobiography-in-progress which we reproduced scarcely do justice to Ah-Fang,
  however, for he was an endlessly fascinating man, with a brain the size of an airship,
  such as that in which he perished. In his memoir The Ah-Fang I Knew, F X Duggleby
  wrote as follows:

  "Ah-Fang harboured certain ideas about phosphorescence, parallelograms, and the
  life cycle of the funnelweb spider which challenge the Weltanschauung, or at least
  my Weltanschauung. He often likened his curiosity about the world to a raven regurgitating
  food for its young, although it is difficult to grasp quite what he meant by this
  analogy. Much given to solitude, he would lie for hours in a tin bath, paring his
  fingernails insouciantly and humming what he called the ''true music of the spheres''.
  At other times, such as cocktail parties, he would start up an unearthly keening,
  pressing a medicine ball to his chest. Fluent in Flemish and Finnish, he was surprisingly
  inarticulate in such exciting languages as Wendisch, or Sorbian, Sea Dayak, Pedi,
  Pangwa, Petit Mauresque and Micmac. His widow Bathsheba once calculated that he
  devised over four hundred distinct recipes for cold soup, despite an abnormality
  of the taste buds which had afflicted him since a childhood accident in a meadow,
  on a Wednesday, with a blowtorch, in a frenzy."

  Duggleby appears to be mistaken regarding Ah-Fang''s cocktail party behaviour, for
  the man who so nearly became Pope, Giordano Sforza, left a vivid account of a bash
  one night on the outskirts of the Vatican in 1923.

  "Ah-Fang, brilliantined and slobbering, entered the room. I could see that his airship-sized
  brain was pulsating more terrifically than it usually did. I could see this because,
  like Ray Milland, I was The Man With X-Ray Eyes. I have always said that my special
  gift cost me the Papacy, but this is not the time to bemoan my slow decline into
  beggardom, penury and insignificance. No, in those days I struck a fine figure as
  the confidante of such men as Ah-Fang. His presence filled the room, despite all
  those glittering chandeliers and the expensive furniture. He spoke but briefly,
  in an aside, to some foreign ambassador of preening contemptibility, and I was unable
  to hear exactly what he said. He spent most of the evening leaning against a harp,
  steadily devouring pies and enchanting a number of floozies with the enigmatically
  mute braggadocio of his flim-flam."

  Ah-Fang''s greatest legacy may well be the dredging of the canal at Gaarg on the
  eve of the Batcake-Akido Conference, a full account of which can be found in Dobson''s
  pamphlet The Dredging Of The Canal At Gaarg On The Eve Of The Batcake-Akido Conference
  (out of print).


  TRICKY DICKY OR THE BELLE OF AMHERST?

  Here at Hooting Yard we are always seeking new ways to help our readers achieve
  self-actualisation in the profoundest sense. To this end we commissioned Professor
  Zoltan Shuddery to devise a quiz based on his theory that all known human personality
  types can be shoehorned into two basic eidolons*. Each of us, argues Shuddery, is
  either a Richard Milhous Nixon or an Emily Dickinson. Try the quiz and see which
  one you are!

  *NOTE :Eidolon, from the Greek, means a spectre or phantom, which suggests that
  the Professor knows not of what he speaks. But it can also mean an idealised image,
  the sense in which it was sometimes used in the early 19th century, so perhaps that
  is what he is driving at.

  1. Do you like to spend long hours gazing wistfully out of an upstairs window in
  Amherst?

  2. Given the chance, would you bomb Cambodia?

  3. Look very, very carefully at the two randomly-generated photographs below. Assuming
  you were invited to share a picnic with one of these people, would it be person
  A or person B?


  Person A is the one on the left. The other one is Person B.

  When you have completed the quiz, send your answers for analysis to Professor Zoltan
  Shuddery at the usual address, marked Who Am I? He will send you a report of no
  less than fourteen closely-typed pages, individually tailored to give you a deep
  and lasting insight into your personality, indeed into your very essence.


  KNITTED BULGARIAN FOLK TALE PUPPET

  Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us readers
  a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that Olympics logo.
  Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial conclave, and
  to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed Blunkettite. The
  real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate to find out what Mrs
  Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?

  Well, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by
  a charity working with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels
  out Pointy Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower
  than the lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even
  the most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because, you
  know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for them,
  and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts--if they actually have
  beating human hearts--by making for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo, hero
  of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.

  We have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would be
  an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh,
  some three years after they originally appeared:

  Ugo Goofs Off

  Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. "There you go, Ugo, goofing off
  again," said Ugo''s ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on his
  boots. "Ma, I''ve got goo on my boots," said Ugo. Ugo''s ma gave him a rag to wipe
  the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags. Ugo''s ma
  was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened the drawer
  of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a gewgaw, for if
  she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn''t get the goo off his boots, but with a rag he
  would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the goo off his boots with
  a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pal Ulf

  In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo, Ugo,"
  said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma made him
  a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf''s bubo. In
  the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo''s ma brought
  food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. "Far be
  it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo''s ma, "But you should put the pancake
  on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo
  was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could
  cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could do. For the
  time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pod

  In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo''s ma said, "Ugo,
  why are you using a pod instead of a jar?" Ugo''s ma was blind, but she knew that
  the plop of Ugo''s pod was different to the plop of his jar. "Oh, ma," said Ugo,
  "My jar is in the shed." Ugo''s ma bashed Ugo on the head. "Never leave your jar
  in the shed, Ugo," she said, "When you do I will bash you on the head, as I just
  did." Ugo said, "Sorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed." "Ah," said Ugo''s
  ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s New Hooter

  Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his
  blind ma''s ear. "Ooh, Ugo," said Ugo''s ma, "That hooter makes a din!" "It''s a
  hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize," said Ugo. "And what did your pal Ulf win,
  Ugo?" asked Ugo''s ma, shelling peas as she spoke. "Ulf won a toy wolf, ma," said
  Ugo, "It''s as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb
  on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars." Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran
  off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Turns Blue

  It was Saint Hector''s Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo''s hood got snagged on
  a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. "Oooo" said Ugo''s
  pal Ulf, "Ugo, you look all blue." "Ack" said Ugo. "I''ll go and fetch your blind
  ma, Ugo, to see what she can do," said Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo''s hood
  off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found
  Ugo''s ma sitting on a stool. "Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "Ugo has turned blue. His hood
  is snagged on a tack." Ugo''s ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool
  and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo''s ma spat out her chew, and it landed
  in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo''s pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo''s ma unsnagged
  Ugo''s hood from the tack. "Ack" said Ugo. "Ooo, Ugo''s ma, I knew you would know
  what to do," said Ulf. Ugo''s ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon, and confiscated
  his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass. At Saint Hector''s
  Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Goes Loopy

  One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the
  yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo''s
  blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started to
  sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo''s ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a goose!"
  Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo''s pal Ulf, who came tumbling
  into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that you, Ugo''s
  pal Ulf?" asked Ugo''s ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is a shrew and a
  goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo''s ma. "No, Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "It''s only
  Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo''s ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo''s pal Ulf off to
  school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.


  THE GOOD BEE

  Do bees make moral choices? Do they know the difference between good and evil? Answering
  these questions was the life''s work of Captain Federico Gull, pirate-turned-apiarist,
  the man who swapped a life being roguish and dastardly on the high seas for one
  spent limping around on his wooden leg among hundreds of beehives in a field.

  Captain Gull had been possibly the most feared buccaneer on the Spanish Main, or
  what was left of it. He was so fierce that he would eat a mouthful of carpet tacks
  for breakfast, washed down with the blood of various animals penned in the cargo
  holds, which he slaughtered with his sharp and shiny scimitar. Unlike the general
  run of pirates, however, he rarely cackled. Indeed he was not given to laughter,
  hideous or otherwise. Underneath the terrifying exterior, he was a thoughtful fellow,
  whose pleasures were found not in fighting and carousing but in resting on his bunk
  with a good book, such as the Rule of St Benedict, in his cabin strewn with the
  blossom of fragrant shrubs. Only when there was a rustle in the piles of blossom,
  and his Lovecraftian shoggoth reared its terrible head and prodded him to bloodlust,
  did Captain Gull become violent. Sometimes he wondered what had become of the rest
  of his crew, for there was not a soul else on board his ship.

  It was in mulling over the inconsistencies of his own behaviour that Captain Gull
  began to think about the ideal of the Good Bee. As luck would have it, one winter''s
  day a huge storm engulfed the ship and it was run aground on a remote island, but
  not before the shoggoth had been hurled overboard by the mighty tempest. Alone at
  last, Captain Gull clumped ashore, drenched and disconcerted, and camped overnight
  in a field. Next morning, exploring his new home, he discovered that the island
  was riddled with swarms of bees. The rest, children, is history.

  MAKING HATS OUT OF WOOD

  The craft of making wooden hats is the subject of a children''s activity weekend
  to be held at Bodger''s Spinney next month. We are predicting excessively foul weather,
  so make sure your tiny tots are wrapped up warm. They will also need to wear special
  boots because of the violent magnetic activity which has been throbbing in the spinney
  since Mister Poxhaven overturned a jar of his experimental substance. The Hooting
  Yard Emergency Response Squadron managed to seal off part of the area, but they
  used plywood for their impromptu fence and during the night it tends to get gnawed
  by voles. This intelligence has been reported by the Pang Hill Vole Watching Club,
  who camp out by the spinney night after night, peering through binoculars and scribbling
  notes on sheets of A2 paper which they pin up each morning on that board outside
  the post office. We should be thankful to every last man jack of them. At the Festival
  of Bears and Pomposity in December they will be given a special prize, made out
  of tin, in recognition of their efforts. Tickets for the children''s activity weekend
  are available from that weird dilapidated kiosk over by the pond. Bring your own
  planks.


  CORMORANT PATROL

  The four hundred men and women of the Blister Lane Cormorant Patrol brandished their
  pencil sharpeners, toffee apples, and inaccurate atlases as they reached the peak
  of the tor after marching all day. Below them, beyond the pig huts, the curiously-stained
  bridge, and the abandoned swimming baths, they were just able to see, shrouded in
  mist, the famous (or infamous) Wotan and Tantalum ponds, so dried up after successive
  droughts that they were now little more than puddles.

  "Onwards!" cried Captain Federico ''Gwyneth'' Paltrow, undisputed leader of the
  Cormorant Patrol and the man whose stupendous energy had helped it thrive even through
  such lean times. Seldom has a puny and diminutive physiognomy been so misleading.

  And so began their descent. Three quarters of the way down, the newest recruit,
  fey young Daisy ''Ricardo'' Montalban, stopped in her tracks, pointed, and yelled
  out: "Look! Look! Something with a beak and feathers!" And indeed, as they peered
  through the enshrouding mist, the others saw it too, perched on the branch of a
  withered pugton tree sprouting hopelessly on the banks of one of the ponds, or puddles.
  Excitedly, they began running, capering and gambolling down the muddy slope of the
  tor. But as they closed upon their prey, they realised it was not a cormorant at
  all. It was a little bittern.
