  IN HIS WOEFUL LECTURE DELIVERED FROM THE BALCONY OF THE CIVIC HALL AT BODGER''S
  SPINNEY ON THURSDAY LAST DURING A HAILSTORM TO A GATHERING OF INGRATES AND ORPHANS

  I wish to refute, while sipping from a glass of milk of magnesia, some of the less
  plausible claims made by that odious charlatan Dennis Cargpan in his woeful and,
  let''s face it, mercenary lecture delivered from the crumbling balcony of the civic
  hall at Bodger''s Spinney on Thursday last during the most tremendous hailstorm
  I have ever seen in my life to a gathering of bestial ingrates and orphans who were
  corralled into the square by Cargpan''s team of electric-cattle-prod-wielding ruffians
  and forced to applaud his preposterous statements.

  Chief among these statements was his contention that toads are shy, usually nocturnal
  animals, hiding during the day in dark, damp places and hopping about at night in
  search of insects, grubs, slugs, worms, and other invertebrates; that they are often
  brownish or greyish in colour and have warty skin, a flat head, swollen parotid
  glands on the side of the neck behind the eyes, bright, jewel-like eyes with a transverse
  pupil, and slightly webbed toes; that they are often stouter than frogs and cannot
  leap as far; that the tongue of the toad is attached to the front of its mouth;
  that the tongue is flicked forward from the mouth, and the sticky tip grasps the
  prey and carries it back to the mouth; that unlike most frogs, most toads do not
  have teeth; that the tongue produces quantities of mucus to help in swallowing;
  that all anurans blink when they swallow; and because there is no bone between the
  eye and the mouth, the eye is pushed against the roof of the mouth, forcing the
  food further back.

  Let me just sip some milk of magnesia before refuting this twaddle.

  There! I refute it, utterly. I do not refute it on the basis of scientific fact,
  nor on my own acute observation of the natural world, nor do I refute it because
  I have read many, many learned papers about toads which counter these statements.
  Similarly, I do not refute it in homage to my mother, who was a self-proclaimed
  expert on toads and passed down her hard-won knowledge to me, because my mother
  was bonkers and confused toads with wrens, and it should come as no surprise that
  all those articles about toads she sent off to the Reader''s Digest and the Daily
  Telegraph were tapped out on a special padded typewriter from her room in the Saint
  Cynthia Mercy Home For The Deranged And Bewildered. No. I refute this drivel simply
  because I bear a grudge against Dennis Cargpan. One day he will burn in hell. In
  the meantime I shall not rest from my refutations of every word he utters from that
  pinched and slippery mouth of his. Well may he regret the day he chuckled at my
  bouffant!


  Eerie golden toads : approach with caution


  WHAT TO DO ON A WINTER''S DAY IN TANTARABIM

  This handy guide has been produced by the Tantarabim Tourist Board, a body riddled
  with corruption from top to toe, although its internal politics need not concern
  the innocent reader who merely wishes to spend a few joyous hours in the bailiwick
  of Tantarabim on a cold and blustery winter''s day, swaddled in woollen garments
  against the elements. Let''s start again. This is a handy guide to the sort of activities
  you and your family can enjoy in Tantarabim during the winter months, should you
  be unlucky enough to have your plane make a forced landing there due to storminess,
  surely the only reason to go anywhere near Tantarabim in the first place, given
  how frightening it is. Having said that, for the tourist who does not mind discomfort
  and privations, Tantarabim can be a source of much entertainment and interest, if
  the words are used loosely. So put on your hat and come with me now as we creep
  past the gore-splattered beasts with venomous fangs which guard all approaches to
  the town, and I shall list at least five things you can do when stuck in Tantarabim
  during a blizzard.

  1. Plummet helplessly down one of the many hidden chutes which deliver you into
  a flaming pit.

  2. Be poked at with pointed sticks by cloven-hoofed imps spitting sulphur. You will
  have lots of fun trying to shake them off, but we guarantee you won''t succeed!

  3. Take a guided tour of the choc ice factory. The price of entry includes the opportunity
  to taste their wares.

  4. Become embroiled in a fight to the death with Bonecrusher Jim, an untamed python
  which has been deprived of food for months.

  5. Spend a night in one of Tantarabim''s many inns, where you will be entranced
  by the primitive gaslight, inexplicable night-time banging and crashing noises,
  swarms of phantom locusts, and walls and ceilings that seem to move when you are
  not looking. Most inns do not charge for children under sixteen, probably because
  they are likely to be abducted by strange amphibious monsters and dragged into the
  sea.


  THE HORRIBLE CAVE--I

  Talk to any spelunker and you will soon learn that nobody who strays into the horrible
  cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns white, they shake
  and gibber, they have to be fed with slops. Others retire to farmyards and spend
  the rest of their lives among pot-bellied pigs. Yet still the reckless and the foolhardy
  risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost I hammered into the ground at the
  approach to the horrible cave. This is the horrible cave, reads my notice, If you
  have a shred of sense you will durst not enter. I spent quite some time on that
  wording, and ended up in hospital because I chewed the end of my pencil so fretfully
  that I contracted lead poisoning. It is by no means a pretty ailment, but I would
  much rather suffer that than the terrible derangements of those who step but once
  into the horrible cave.

  While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent who was curious
  about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency, for he was dressed
  in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had a very close-cropped
  haircut, carried an attache case which I noticed was chained to his wrist, and he
  seemed to exude the scent of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a telltale sign
  of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside the bed on which I lay splayed
  out, he introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. "Not to be confused with the
  actor who played Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun," he added hurriedly, although
  at that time the name was new to me. I have since followed the agent''s namesake''s
  career with growing interest.

  I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near the
  horrible cave, and answered as best as I could, given my fevered state. The agent
  made notes on a little hand-held pneumatic turbonotepad of ingenious design. I often
  find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days you are lucky to find
  one at a jumble sale or in a junk shop, luckier still if all the notes made on it
  are still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished interrogating me in his
  strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbopad and, with a surprisingly
  loud hiss, it clunked into hibernation mode. I watched the jet of escaping steam.

  Years later, sitting in a cafe in a tremendous town, flicking idly through an intelligence
  journal, I learned that Agent Plummer had been exposed as an alien life-form from
  some far planet riddled with horrible caves. I thought how fortunate we were to
  have only one horrible cave, terrible as it was.

  Last week I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still there. Prancing majestically
  along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people being attacked by cows.
  Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said being attacked by crows. One
  poor wretch who had been pecked at was slumped beside his makeshift tent, fruitlessly
  trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I knelt down beside him and gave him a
  hand, and could not resist asking what was happening, but he was unable to speak.
  I surmised, however, that the crows must have flown from the direction of the horrible
  cave. Perhaps they nested there unbeknown to the local bird inspectors. It seemed
  like a good idea to forget about my signpost for the day and go to the headquarters
  of the bird inspection team instead, so that''s what I did.

  Although it was at least fourteen years since last I had roamed these parts, I still
  recalled the bus routes, so after making sure the pecked man''s head bandage was
  not too tight, I changed direction and cut across the moors towards the bus stop.
  It was a dismaying sight, for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which
  the timetable had been pinned up was smashed and the timetable itself torn to shreds.
  Further evidence of violent crow activity, as if any were needed.

  The bus pulled up at this dismal scene a few minutes later. I clambered on board
  and became somewhat uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going
  to be one of those frightening journeys where the driver would turn to look at me
  and I would see that he was a fiend in human form, cackling hideously as the bus
  hurtled to perdition? I had forgotten that it was Saint Eustace''s Day, and that
  most people, except for me and the bus driver and the people being attacked by crows
  would be staying indoors, in darkness, behind fastened shutters, imploring the saint
  to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming twelvemonth. I hoped that the
  bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on this special
  day, and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while the driver steered
  his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route.

  When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes than the bus braked sharply,
  jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed, for which I reprimanded him. He apologised
  for his rudery, then pointed in front of him, and I saw that the road was blocked
  by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked in filth, standing on
  a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver
  and I exchanged looks of befuddlement, then he reached under his seat and hoisted
  up a rectangular tin which he opened to reveal a clotted mass of stale food. He
  invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a
  number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver,
  who began shovelling the food into his mouth with his surprisingly dainty fingers.
  I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer, flaking off in places
  as if it had been applied some time ago. His eating habits were so repulsive that
  I turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now.
  I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side
  of the road. As I got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was
  mistaken? But no, there was no doubting it. Underneath all the caked muck, I recognised
  my father!

  "Papa!" I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible.
  He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible tongue, the
  sky that was now growing black as monstrous clouds swept in from the west. I am
  tempted to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were
  not. I snivelled a bit and then remembered why I had got off the bus in the first
  place. It was clear to me, however, that asking my father to shift his barrel out
  of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over
  and cleared the way myself. The laws here on toppling preacher men are draconian,
  and I would have to make sure I did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver
  was too intent on bolting his food and would not be paying attention. If he saw
  me push my pa off the barrel he would almost certainly inform on me, for we all
  know the reputation of bus company personnel, hand in hand with the police force,
  at least in this neck of the woods, for obvious historical reasons. As for my father,
  would he lay an accusation against his only son? It was a risk I had to take.

  Just as I was nerving myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant
  fancy which had been nestling dormant in my brain until that moment. I am utterly
  perplexed as to why it suddenly uncoiled itself, as it were, and sprang to the forefront
  of my mind, casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision--so very vivid!--of
  myself dressed in rags, exhaustedly swinging a leper bell from my withered arm.

  Weird, that. I slapped myself on the forehead a couple of times to dispel the hallucination,
  came to my senses, yanked my father''s ankle so that he fell off the barrel, pushed
  the barrel over and rolled it to the kerb, and got back on the bus. The driver had
  finished his lunch, so, swerving slightly to avoid my father, who was sat in the
  road dusting himself down, he drove me to my stop ten minutes walk from the bird
  inspection unit. What I found there was brain-dizzying.

  NOTA BENE : Younger readers should note that this piece first appeared as long ago
  as 2004. There are two further episodes, which will be posted in the next couple
  of days.


  TALES OF THE RIVERBANK AND THE MARSHES

  The riverbank of which I speak was inhabited by glamorous moles. There were dozens
  of them, each more glamorous than the last, and the one who engages our attention
  on this damp Wednesday is the most glamorous mole of all. Her name is Hortense.
  Before you start complaining about the regrettable practice of anthropomorphising
  riverbank creatures, please bear in mind that not a jot of that is going on here.
  The mole was called Hortense and she was extremely glamorous. She wore a sort of
  mole version of a cloche hat, but there was nothing remotely human about her. She
  was just a mole, albeit one so glamorous that other moles swooned in her presence.
  Have you ever seen a mole swoon? It is quite a sight, and you will do well to have
  your camera at the ready. On the Wednesday of which I speak, there were many swooning
  moles to be seen by the riverbank. And we have not even begun to explore the marshes!

  Out in the spooky marshes, at dead of night, nothing stirred. Nothing except tiny
  nocturnal creatures whose habitat was marsh and fen. Cock an ear and you might hear
  scrabblings and scurryings, fugitive wisps of sound in the otherwise eerie silence.
  There you sit in your concrete pillbox, a primed grenade in one hand and a mug of
  tomato soup in the other. The dampness of your socks is most distressing. You are
  distressed by the dampness of your socks, in the marshes, in the night, but why
  are you holding a hand grenade? Is this wartime? Surely in wartime you would not
  be fobbed off with damp socks? A bat appears near your head, and you flinch. These
  marshes are known for their colonies of bats. Wisely, you sip your soup. It is piping
  hot. The air around the marshes is not.


  BELL

  Imagine you have never used a telephone before. It rings, and you pick up the receiver.
  You don''t know that the social convention is to say "Hello?" or "Dobson here. Who''s
  calling?" or something similar. So what do you say? One man who faced this dilemma
  was, of course, Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the thing, or at least got the
  patent on it. His preferred manner of answering the telephone was to shout "Ahoy!"
  This seems to me far more exciting than a dull "Hello", and it''s a pity that Bell''s
  habit never caught on. It is, of course, never too late to overturn various social
  conventions. If we all started yelling "Ahoy!" when answering the telephone, the
  world would be just a little bit more pleasurable.

  .

  Bell : Ahoy!

  On a vaguely related note, I take this opportunity to mention that the first ever
  message sent in Morse code, by Samuel Morse himself, was "What hath God wrought?"


  PIE SHOP DEEP SPACE SIX

  Remarkably, it is seven years ago today that Hooting Yard readers learned of the
  exciting radio serial Pie Shop Deep Space Six. My informants tell me that it is
  still at the development stage, beset by teething problems. Here is that original
  announcement:

  Hurtling at inhuman speed through the universe, the thoroughly exciting spaceship
  Double Pneumonia was headed for a galaxy so distant that it would take billions
  upon billions of generations of leafcutter ants to reach it. In command on the bridge
  was Star Captain Barbara Bel Geddes, accompanied by First Officer Mister Unstrebnodtalb,
  who was only half human. No one had ever worked out what weird extraterrestrial
  life-form had spawned his other half, and it was best not to ask, for therein lay
  madness.

  And a certain madcap frenzy is what you can expect in the new science fiction drama
  Pie Shop Deep Space Six, currently being developed by a crack team headed by Mrs
  Gubbins, who has returned to Haemoglobin Towers. The elderly crone has put down
  her knitting and, fuelled by lots of piping hot cups of tea, is conjuring up some
  thrilling ideas for this new radio serial.

  In episode one, for example, hostile plasmatronic aliens launch an attack on space
  station Epsilon Nova X-977, cutting off pastry supplies to the pie shop. Mister
  Unstrebnodtalb outwits them using a supersonic brain-zapping process involving lots
  of sparks and whooshing noises.

  Mrs Gubbins has asked Sir Harrison Birtwistle to compose the theme music.

  LINES WRITTEN IN A SORDID HUT

  The dilapidated walls, the mouldering plaster, the blackened mantel-pieces, the
  stained and polluted wainscots--under license of a fop! Wrath, wrath immeasurable,
  unimaginable, unmitigable, burned at my heart like a cancer; the worst had come,
  among weeds and forgetfulness, the blank treachery of hollowness. A pageant of vapory
  exhalations; thick clouds and vapours. Hoist by the fop''s petard, I could but drool.
