full_text: 'THE TEUTONIC MEMORY-BANKS OF MISTER BLATFINCH

  I want to bestow a prize on Mister Blatfinch. A cup perhaps, or trophy. Or just
  a cup. He has just published his second book. The first was a word-for-word transcription
  of That Hideous Strength by C S Lewis, differing from the original only in that
  the sentences are jumbled up in no particular order, or not one that I can decipher.
  In his postface, Mister Blatfinch claims to have "wrested from this lamentable Christian
  apologist''s noxious sci fi potboiler a new and urgent text, or re-text, or uber-text,
  or we might go so far as to say a proto-Blatfinchesque text, the one he meant to
  write, had he not been C S Lewis". Make of that what you will, or, as I did, dismiss
  it as the raving of a nincompoop.

  His second book could not be more different from the first. Indeed, I made a point
  of checking that it was the same Mister Blatfinch, by doing a forensic comparison
  of the author photographs on the dust jackets of both volumes. You can carry out
  the same task yourself:


  All I can say is that if those are two different authors, then Lord love a duck,
  you can knock me down with a feather and call me "Fontanelle, Bernard le Bovier
  de (1657-1757)", and I''ll wager you some pins and a cork or two for all that! The
  reason I want to give Mister Blatfinch some sort of award is because this second
  book of his is a delightful and entertaining memoir, rather than a vapid bit of
  twaddle. Not only that, but it rekindled my own memories of that very special time
  in the early 1970s when it seemed that "Krautrock" could revolutionise the way we
  listened to popular music. Remember Amon Duul? Magma? Popol Vuh? So does Mister
  Blatfinch. Well, he gives each of these groups a mention in his index, even if they
  are curiously absent from the body of the text itself. But that can be excused,
  for the book--My Teutonic Memory-Banks--is essentially a narrative of the author''s
  experiences as a sound engineer with the forgotten group Dob Suun.

  Dob Suun took their name from the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson, and the lyrics
  to all their songs are taken from illegal German translations of some of his more...
  shall we say, "arresting" ornithological texts. The moving spirit in Dob Suun was
  lead singer, spinettist and all-round wild man Horst Brotzenkammernvergleist, who
  found a cache of pirated Dobson pamphlets when sorting through his father''s papers
  after the latter''s death. (Brotzenkammernvergleist Senior died during the so-called
  Weems Terror of 1967.)

  It is to our great good fortune that Mister Blatfinch''s memoir ends before the
  group degenerated into the turgid heavy metal monsters they became. Commercial success
  ruined them, of course, and they were never quite the same after being invited to
  support The Captain & Tenille on a tour of Canada, Alaska and Papua New Guinea as
  the 1970s ground to an ignominious end. Join me, then, as I beat my breast earnestly,
  raining a thousand and one "thank you"s upon Mister Blatfinch''s remarkably-attired
  head for reminding me of the glorious days of those ear-splitting yet valiant albums
  Poisoned Linnets and The Ten Thousand Chaffinches Of Dr T.

  Incidentally, tone deaf readers who prefer the latter-day Dob Suun may be interested
  in this article on the Heavy Metal Umlaut.


  MY LITTLE BLIND DOLLY

  I have a little blind dolly. She is stuffed with straw. I have not named her yet.
  I have only had her for half an hour. I found her on a patch of waste ground, half
  an hour ago. I was out walking. I suppose I should say I was out limping, because
  I limp when I walk. My left leg is shorter than my right leg on account of a mysterious
  childhood illness. I was limping along near the canal when I passed a patch of waste
  ground and saw the blind dolly stuffed with straw. She had been abandoned, possibly
  by some ungrateful infant. Ingratitude is the besetting sin of today''s infants.
  That is my opinion, not shared by all. Rooting around on the waste ground I noticed
  other things, including a pair of blue buttons. I think I can say with some confidence
  that they were made of bakelite. I supposed that they may have been the eyes of
  my little blind dolly once upon a time. But they had become detached, perhaps when
  she was thrown with a certain amount of violence on to the patch of waste ground
  from the wound-down window of a Chevrolet passing at high speed in the back seat
  of which an ungrateful infant was throwing a tantrum. That would fit the facts as
  I found them. I did think about sewing the buttons back on to my little blind dolly''s
  cloth head, about twenty five minutes ago, but decided against doing so. She has
  been robbed of her sight and I do not presume to play God. I have placed both buttons
  in my pocket, however, in case they come in handy for another purpose, a purpose
  which will be revealed to me at the due time. For the moment I am concerned with
  selecting a name for my little blind dolly. No doubt the ungrateful infant who tossed
  her aside had a name for her, but in twenty thousand years I would be unable to
  guess what it was. It is not as if she has her name embroidered on the sole of her
  cloth foot. At home I have a whole shelf full of books by Tony Buzan. They are all
  packed with tips to make better use of my brain, but not one of them tells me how
  to pronounce the author''s name. Is it BOO-z''n or Byoo-ZAN? Until I find out, my
  little blind dolly will have to have two names. She will be Susan Buzan or Suzanne
  Buzan. I am going to make a little black cape for her to wear, just like Tony Buzan''s
  cape, only smaller, because she is not a living breathing mind map maker, she is
  just my little blind dolly. I will find a small piece of cloth for the cape, and
  if it is not already black, I will have to dye it, or smear it all over with black
  boot polish. I have got more black boot polish than I know what to do with. I often
  think about that song by Jethro Tull, Doctor Bogenbroom, because I bought all the
  boot polish from a cobbler named Mister Bogenbroom when he shut up his shop. He
  told me he was going to sea, but he did not say which sea he meant. It could have
  been the Baltic, the Red, or the Dead, or one of the other ones. I didn''t ask him,
  because he was quite a frightening man, and in those days I did not have my little
  blind dolly to hide behind. But now I have, and nothing will ever frighten me again.


  MY LITTLE BLIND CROW

  So there I was, kneading dough, thinking about Edgar Allan Poe, and my heart fit
  to burst about my little blind crow. The moon was full and it cast a glow. Santa
  in the chimney said "Ho ho ho". I wept hot tears for my little blind crow. The wind
  doth howl, the gale doth blow. They used to call Stalin "Uncle Joe", but Stalin
  never sobbed all night for my little blind crow. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme.
  Brother, can you spare a dime? Sister, are you too crumpled with woe when you think
  about my little blind crow? They say that Stalin''s five-year plans made Russia
  strong. But that has nothing to do with my song. I want it set to music by Status
  Quo. A sad, sad song for my little blind crow.


  THE ADVENTURES OF TINY ENID

  Tiny Enid knew all there was to know about the capture of ostriches. As we sat together
  gulping down tumblers of lukewarm tap water, she gave me some tips.

  "Here are some precautions," she said, "Avoid excessive exertion and rough handling
  during capture, otherwise sudden death or permanent collapse will occur as a result
  of muscle damage. Ostriches that go down as a result of capture stress usually die
  of secondary problems such as pneumonia or renal failure. It is imperative that
  stress factors be minimized. Capture only at low ambient temperature (around 28degC),
  prevent overexertion, and minimize handling of the captured birds.

  "When attempting to capture ostriches in camps or in small enclosures, be very careful
  not to herd the ostriches into the fence. The fence can be used as a guide to steer
  the bird into a capture boma, but not as a net. Broken legs and lacerations are
  the usual outcome of a poorly planned capture operation. Ensure that iron standards
  and fallen trees are not in the path of the running birds.

  "Once an ostrich is caught, always be aware that the powerful legs are effectively
  used for defence. The bird will try to disembowel or at least maim its captors.
  Stay away from the front of the bird unless you have control of the head with the
  neck held at full extension and lower than the bird''s back."

  "Those are very useful hints, Tiny Enid," I said, and I was grateful to have heard
  them, for who knew when I might be sent out to capture an ostrich?

  "I haven''t finished, Lancelot," she said. My name is not Lancelot, but Tiny Enid
  had for many years had a fixation upon the actor Lance Percival, and the symptoms
  of her mania cropped up in unexpected ways. I made a snap decision not to contradict
  her, for she had been known to throw fits and dribble when confused, and I hated
  having to mop up anybody''s dribble, let alone Tiny Enid''s. "Go on," I said.

  "For mass capture of ostriches in a large camp or in the wild," she continued, "the
  use of the plastic capture boma is very successful. Young ostriches up to two years
  of age are often found in large groups called creches: these creche units can number
  up to sixty birds. Due to their strong herding instinct these units can easily be
  manipulated and chased into a capture boma using a helicopter.

  "Once the ostriches are in the boma they should be allowed to rest for at least
  an hour before they are loaded. Excited and hot birds tend to panic when loaded
  immediately into mass crates and will pile on top of each other and trample each
  other. The use of a shield to force the birds gently forward and up the ramp will
  minimize injury to the birds and the handlers. Large, aggressive males can sometimes
  be problematic. These should be placed on their own in separate crates."

  "That sounds like a very good idea, Tiny Enid," I said, as she paused for a sip
  of her water. Across the fields, we could see wild hogs careering madly into the
  swamp, and the faint silhouette of a watercolourist sat at their easel, attempting
  to capture the scene.

  "When time is not a factor," said Tiny Enid, "a pop-up corral set up around a watering
  point or a small patch of lucerne with supplemental feeding is a useful method for
  the capture of ostriches. The birds are allowed to enter the capture corral on their
  own, and stress levels are kept to a minimum as no chasing of the birds occurs."

  She paused again, took a cigarillo from her pocket, and asked me if I had any matches.
  I fumbled for my little box, but it was damp.

  "I''m afraid my matches are damp, Tiny Enid," I said.

  "If you blow on them, they will eventually become dry, Lancelot," she advised. "While
  you do so, here are some final points. Never capture ostriches at high ambient temperatures.
  Do not handle ostriches roughly during capture. Do not chase the birds excessively
  during the capture procedure. Never use a net gun to capture ostriches. Never chase
  ostriches into a fence to capture them. Are your matches dry yet?"

  "No, they are not," I panted.

  "In that case," said Tiny Enid, replacing the cigarillo in her pocket, "I suppose
  I shall have to visit the newsagents." And she sipped the last of her water, rose
  from her chair, kissed me lightly on the forehead, and walked away.

  Years later, in a secondhand shop, I found a watercolour painting of wild hogs in
  a swamp done in pinks and greens and pale yellows, and I bought it, because I wondered
  if it was the painting made on that golden afternoon when I sat with Tiny Enid for
  the very last time.


  SOME RARE EDITIONS OF THE BIBLE : NUMBER ONE

  Scholars, theologians, and indeed plain old book-lovers have long been intrigued
  by various anomalous editions of the Holy Bible. In this new series, Hooting Yard''s
  own expert on such matters, Fatima Gilliblat, will be examining some of her favourites.
  She begins with a rare Bible from 1982:

  The so-called Emperor Rosko Bible of 1982 is astonishingly rare. In fact, some people,
  who ought to know better, have suggested that it is a figment of my own fancy. Such
  accusers are hotheads unfit to lick my theological bootees, and should be discouraged
  from making any pronouncements upon these matters whatsoever, at least until such
  time as they have been forced to memorise all eighty-nine chapters of the Codex
  Gilliblatiana, wherein I expound my learning with verve and wit. I recommend it
  as suitable holiday reading, if you have a suitcase big enough to contain it. But
  enough of self-advertisement.

  The Emperor Rosko Bible is so called because the four gospels in the New Testament
  were comprehensively rewritten by a quartet of clapped-out Radio One disc jockeys,
  including the eponymous Emperor Rosko (Matthew), Ed "Stewpot" Stewart (Mark), Dave
  Lee Travis, otherwise known, at least by himself and his immediate family, as "The
  Hairy Cornflake" (Luke), and finally Diddy David Hamilton (John). The remainder
  of the New Testament, and all of the Old Testament, follows the standard Douai version,
  except for the Book of Isaiah, which has been expunged for no apparent reason. My
  copy is bound in bloodstained bandages abstracted from a locker in the basement
  of a mysterious clinic high in the Swiss alps.

  Only eight copies of the Emperor Rosko Bible were ever made, and they were given
  away as prizes at a Radio One Roadshow held in the North Yorkshire seaside town
  of Whitby. The combination of the bloodstains and the resonance of Bram Stoker''s
  Dracula that still hangs over Whitby I find strangely appealing.


  JAR HINTS

  I must make a confession. Here in the Haemoglobin Towers branch office, where the
  website is put together by a team of volunteers from the Bodger''s Spinney Home
  For The Bewildered, The Withered & The Fraught, there has lain neglected in a damp
  corner a bulging sack full of letters, all of which are pleas from readers who seek
  urgent advice on their jars. I can offer no satisfactory excuse for having ignored
  them for so long. Much as I would like to throw blame upon our temporary janitor,
  the defrocked papal nuncio ex-Monsignor Shudderyhead, I cannot do so. With his hacking
  cough, boils, and seeming unwillingness ever to wash his hair, he makes an easy
  target, but despite his numberless crimes we make every effort to bolster his self-esteem.
  Only last week Mrs Gubbins gave him her soiled copy of one of David Icke''s books
  about extraterrestrial lizard people, and the crones in the ActiveX Plug-In Division
  have been saving him their boiled sweet wrappers for a month. But enough office
  gossip! Here, with apologies for its lateness, is the jar advice so many readers
  have been waiting for:

  It is vitally important to keep all your substances in separate, labelled jars.
  Nothing good can come of mistaking your turps for your suet, or vice versa. It can
  also help to arrange your jars in alphabetical order, to wit: blubber, crusts, curd,
  dew, grease, orts, pips, spume, ullage, vapour, whey. (This of course is only an
  example, as you may own an entirely different set of substances.)

  I trust that will suffice.


  ABOUT BELT, BONG & YAW

  Red huts on the horizon stank of steam. Yaw''s boil made Belt more hollow. He went
  towards the lighthouse with paint from the hotels. Bong spoke of coastguards, anvils,
  butter and Yaw. Belt felt sick. Bong stank of starch. Yaw had his wax. He broke
  up in the potters.

  Horses had got Bong all worn out. Belt''s more furtive. He''s got lawns. Yaw caught
  a fever. Bong yelped. Wellington boots pained him. Yaw was floored. Belt took a
  closer look. Things looked black. Bong had gravy in his sack. Some of Yaw''s pancakes
  took Bong aback. He kept on mentioning Belt behind his back. Yaw was careful with
  his spoon. Belt went to the kennels. Bong rang a bell. He threw up in his dinner.
  That made Yaw gawp. He curled up by the sails. They put Bong in prison. He was all
  tucked up. Yaw wrote a letter to his mother. Belt was in the pantry helping Bong
  make butter.

  Fooling around in Didcot, Yaw found some bones. Those bones were Bong''s bones.
  Belt''s matron ate his cheese. Yaw muttered. He fell about in fits. At the waterworks,
  Belt broke corks. His elk was in a tent. It looked like Bong. Bread rolls and snacks
  were stacked in crates. Yaw put them by his flask. He threw up on some rudders.

  Bong''s belt made Belt choke. Yaw coughed up. Hooks in Bong''s bungalow looked like
  claws. But Belt kept calm. Yaw disembarked from a barge. His harbour was red. Belt''s
  was blue. He struck a match. Bong bent twine. His coat was torn. His gun was stuck.
  Belt''s pottery had to be glued. But Yaw''s was hard. It looked like wood. Bong
  had said it would. Bong stank. But Belt had other irons. They raged. Bong''s grew.
  Yaw had no irons in the fire. He kept them in his lockers.'
