full_text: 'KNITTED BULGARIAN FOLK TALE PUPPET

  Ahoy, Mr Key!, writes Dr Ruth Pastry, Thank you so much for affording us readers
  a glimpse of the inner workings of Hooting Yard in your piece on that Olympics logo.
  Brief as it was, I was fascinated by the reference to the editorial conclave, and
  to the fact that the bloated janitor remains an unreconstructed Blunkettite. The
  real reason I am writing, however, is because I am desperate to find out what Mrs
  Gubbins was knitting. Can you tell me?

  Well, Ruth, yes I can! A few weeks ago, the octogenarian crone was approached by
  a charity working with the filthy and destitute denizens of that cluster of hovels
  out Pointy Town way. As you may know, these ill-starred wretches are even lower
  than the lowest of the low, wallowing in a dank pit of turpitude and lacking even
  the most basic sanitation. Other charitable organisations shun them because, you
  know, there are limits. Anyway, Mrs Gubbins was asked to knit something for them,
  and she wisely decided to bring a little joy to their hearts--if they actually have
  beating human hearts--by making for them a life-size knitted puppet of Ugo, hero
  of a series of exciting Bulgarian folk tales.

  We have published a number of Ugo stories here at Hooting Yard, so this would be
  an opportune time to pluck them from the Archive and present all six here afresh,
  some three years after they originally appeared:

  Ugo Goofs Off

  Ugo lived in Plovdiv. In the fog, Ugo goofed off. "There you go, Ugo, goofing off
  again," said Ugo''s ma. It was foggy. Ugo stepped in some goo. He got it on his
  boots. "Ma, I''ve got goo on my boots," said Ugo. Ugo''s ma gave him a rag to wipe
  the goo off his boots. She had a drawer of gewgaws. Gewgaws and rags. Ugo''s ma
  was blind, so when Ugo goofed off and got goo on his boots, she opened the drawer
  of gewgaws and rags and rummaged, feeling for a rag rather than a gewgaw, for if
  she gave Ugo a gewgaw he wouldn''t get the goo off his boots, but with a rag he
  would. Ugo sat in the porch after goofing off and wiped the goo off his boots with
  a rag. In the fog. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pal Ulf

  In Plovdiv, Ugo had a pal called Ulf. Ulf had the plague. "Look at my bubo, Ugo,"
  said Ulf. "Oooh!" said Ugo when he saw the bubo. Ugo had the flu. His ma made him
  a tincture for his flu but there was not much she could do about Ulf''s bubo. In
  the Plovdiv lazaretto, Ulf mooched about in a foul mood. Ugo and Ugo''s ma brought
  food for Ulf. "Have some pancakes, Ulf," said Ugo. Ulf gobbled a pancake. "Far be
  it from me to poo-poo you, Ulf," said Ugo''s ma, "But you should put the pancake
  on your bubo, like a poultice." "Oh," said Ulf. He did as bid, and soon his bubo
  was gone. But Ugo still had the flu, so his ma was thrown for a loop. She could
  cure the plague but not the flu, and did not know what else she could do. For the
  time being. In the lazaretto in Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s Pod

  In the old town of Plovdiv, Ugo plopped his pod onto a stool. Ugo''s ma said, "Ugo,
  why are you using a pod instead of a jar?" Ugo''s ma was blind, but she knew that
  the plop of Ugo''s pod was different to the plop of his jar. "Oh, ma," said Ugo,
  "My jar is in the shed." Ugo''s ma bashed Ugo on the head. "Never leave your jar
  in the shed, Ugo," she said, "When you do I will bash you on the head, as I just
  did." Ugo said, "Sorry, ma. My pal Ulf put my jar in the shed." "Ah," said Ugo''s
  ma. On Thursday last. In a hovel. In the old town of Plovdiv.

  Ugo''s New Hooter

  Back in Plovdiv, Ugo won a hooter as a booby prize. Ugo tooted his hooter in his
  blind ma''s ear. "Ooh, Ugo," said Ugo''s ma, "That hooter makes a din!" "It''s a
  hooter, ma. I won it as a booby prize," said Ugo. "And what did your pal Ulf win,
  Ugo?" asked Ugo''s ma, shelling peas as she spoke. "Ulf won a toy wolf, ma," said
  Ugo, "It''s as noisy as my booby prize hooter, because when you press your thumb
  on its tum, the toy wolf that Ulf won roars." Ugo tooted his hooter again and ran
  off to find Ulf. On a very wet Tuesday. Near the old fort. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Turns Blue

  It was Saint Hector''s Day in the old town of Plovdiv. Ugo''s hood got snagged on
  a tack and he turned blue, or, as Carl Sagan used to say, blooow. "Oooo" said Ugo''s
  pal Ulf, "Ugo, you look all blue." "Ack" said Ugo. "I''ll go and fetch your blind
  ma, Ugo, to see what she can do," said Ulf, though he could have pulled Ugo''s hood
  off the tack on which it was snagged. But Ulf had been sniffing glue. Ulf found
  Ugo''s ma sitting on a stool. "Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "Ugo has turned blue. His hood
  is snagged on a tack." Ugo''s ma was chewing a chew, but she jumped off her stool
  and ran to Ugo, who was indeed very blue. Ugo''s ma spat out her chew, and it landed
  in a pot of glue. It was the glue Ugo''s pal Ulf had been sniffing. Ugo''s ma unsnagged
  Ugo''s hood from the tack. "Ack" said Ugo. "Ooo, Ugo''s ma, I knew you would know
  what to do," said Ulf. Ugo''s ma clouted Ulf on the head with a spoon, and confiscated
  his glue. Ugo went off to find his shoes. It was time for mass. At Saint Hector''s
  Cathedral. On the Left Bank. In Plovdiv.

  Ugo Goes Loopy

  One morning in Plovdiv, Ugo went loopy. He put on his shoes and went out to the
  yard and made a noise like a shrew. Thinking there was a shrew in her yard, Ugo''s
  blind ma tooted her hooter to alert the Plovdiv Shrew Patrol. But Ugo started to
  sound like a goose. "Ooo," said Ugo''s ma, "What am I to do? A shrew and a goose!"
  Then Ugo began to moo, like a cow. "Wow!" said Ugo''s pal Ulf, who came tumbling
  into the yard dressed up like a moose, for Ulf was loopy too. "Is that you, Ugo''s
  pal Ulf?" asked Ugo''s ma. "Woo woo woo," said Ulf. "Ulf, there is a shrew and a
  goose and a cow in my yard," said Ugo''s ma. "No, Ugo''s ma," said Ulf, "It''s only
  Ugo being loopy." "Ah," said Ugo''s ma. She packed Ugo and Ugo''s pal Ulf off to
  school. On a tram. In Plovdiv.


  THE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT JEZEBEL OF BOTNIA, HER IMPENDING FLU JAB, AND THE HOWLING
  OF WOLVES AT DUSK

  "Pins, pins, pins..." muttered Clavdia as she mooched about the hotel lobby thinking
  about embroidery projects. The Jezebel of Botnia needed something to take her mind
  off her impending flu jab, for the very thought of injections made her wince, wince
  and gnash her teeth, wince and gnash her teeth and shudder, wince and gnash her
  teeth and shudder and shake, wince and gnash her teeth and shudder and shake and
  sometimes even swoon, and she did not want to swoon here in the hotel lobby, so
  she concentrated hard on her embroidery projects.


  One, a depiction of the crushing of the Fashingu! by Drubbage in 1864. Two, much
  ivy and elecampine twirled around a tower. Three, a set of tea-towels showing Rex
  Harrison with each of his wives, including additional fictional wives fermented
  in Clavdia''s brain. Clavdia had named them Hortense, Flopsy and Gaar.


  Her flu jab was imminent because Clavdia''s doctor was famed throughout Botnia for
  her unparalleled preventative techniques. She had devised a schedule of inoculations
  for all her patients, not just Clavdia, and none of them had fallen victim to influenza,
  diphtheria, plague, tappings, the dengue or calenture for years. Clavdia had more
  than once asked Doctor Dacoit if there was anything she could do about her lactose-intolerance,
  and the good doctor was working on it. She had suggested the regular application
  of an experimental poultice, but that had not been a success, and Clavdia found
  that her temper was frayed rather more often than usual after sitting with the poultice
  on her brow for a few hours.


  The hotel lobby was hot and had many flies in it.


  Clavdia left the hotel to have her flu jab. Afterwards, she spent some time traipsing
  aimlessly by the canal, then picked up some groceries from the grocery, and made
  her way home, armed with aubergines and beetroot and custard and a disco dancing
  CD and eggplant and futile dreams of being plucked from her futile existence in
  Botnia, and as she trod the familiar path home, wolves howled, wolves howled in
  the night, just like wolves always do.


  THE NAMES OF THE PONDS

  by Frank Key

  The first pond is called POSTAGE STAMP POND not, as one might think, due to its
  tininess--for it is indeed a tiny pond!--but because it was the scene of the 1898
  Postage Stamp Riots. You will recall from your schoolbooks that the introduction
  of a new machine at the sorting office led to unrest.

  The second pond is named MEE JAWR POND which is thought to be a corruption of the
  name Midge Ure. Mr Ure was a balladeer & minstrel of the last century, now largely
  forgotten, although there exists a dwindling band of devotees who gather together
  underneath railway bridges and viaducts to sing extempore versions of his profound
  meditation upon vapidity, Vienna--it means nothing to me. Appropriately enough,
  this pond is unfathomably deep.

  The third pond, everybody''s favourite, is called POND O'' CAKES. It was in this
  pond, on a teeming day in April in the year of the Munich Air Disaster, that a canister
  of protoplasmic goo from another dimension was found in the fishing-net of a little
  tike named Chevenix Perkins. Young Perkins was the only-begotten son of the disgraced
  insecticide merchant Slawkenbergius Perkins, late, not of this parish, but of another
  parish entirely, where eldritch groans and wailings would often be heard emerging
  from dilapidated barnyards and abandoned bomb shelters, the like of which--the groans
  and wailings, that is--no human ear ought ever be suffered to hear in this brief
  mortal existence. (That sentence is a translation from the original Hungarian.)
  Little Chevenix gave his find to the Museum At-or-Near-the-Gruesome-Copse at Ack,
  from where it has since disappeared.

  Pond number four was for a long time nameless, but has recently been dubbed BIRDS''
  POND because of the masonry pillar just to the north, on which is inscribed this
  sentence from John Burroughs'' Birds And Poets (1877) : "The defiant scream of the
  hawk circling aloft, the wild whinny of the loon, the whooping of the crane, the
  booming of the bittern, the vulpine bark of the eagle, the loud trumpeting of the
  migratory geese sounding down out of the midnight sky; or by the seashore, the coast
  of New Jersey or Long Island, the wild crooning of the flocks of gulls, repeated,
  continued by the hour, swirling sharp and shrill, rising and falling like the wind
  in a storm, as they circle above the beach or dip to the dash of the waves,--are
  much more welcome in certain moods than any and all mere bird-melodies, in keeping
  as they are with the shaggy and untamed features of ocean and woods, and suggesting
  something like the Richard Wagner music in the ornithological orchestra."

  The fifth pond, WORSE-THINGS-HAPPEN-AT-SEA POND is barely what you would call a
  pond at all. It has been called a puddle. Some have dubbed it a mere. One authority
  on landlocked pools of water has called it a tarn, albeit inaccurately, as it is
  at (or at least near) sea level. It would appear that the appellation "authority"
  is thus equally inaccurate, although few have questioned it, as the pond-boffin
  concerned is none other than Cloris Preen, niece of the notorious Lothar, and ex-wife
  of the beetle-browed turps magnate Hengist Shad. Cloris Preen''s Universal Gazetteer
  of Ponds, Meres & Similar Bodies of Water Across The Globe, Indexed By Depth, Hue
  & Mean Temperature, With Thousands of Diagrams & Lots & Lots of Exciting Maps is
  reputedly the longest single-volume book ever published, although most scholars
  hold it in contempt. Worse-Things-Happen-At-Sea Pond is notable for the weird iridescent
  glow it emits on certain saints'' feast days, usually those of St Bartholomew (24th
  August), often invoked against nervous diseases and twitching, St Ambrose (7th December),
  patron saint of beekeepers and wax refiners, and St Rita of Cascia (22nd May) patron
  saint of desperate cases. Should Cloris Preen be classed as a desperate case?

  We come now to FIENDISH POND, home to a bewildering array of aquatic life forms
  which I am afraid I have not had time to catalogue. Some of them look like monsters
  from H P Lovecraft--and those are the less frightening ones! Terrorised infants
  can often be seen running away screaming from this pond, only to become entangled
  in a nearby thicket of nettles and bindweed, the poor mites.

  Shuddering, let us attempt to push the tentacled and sucker-festooned denizens of
  Fiendish Pond to the backs of our minds and consider instead MARY MOONMAN POND,
  named after one of the key witnesses to the assassination of John F Kennedy on 22nd
  November 1963. Her name is (was?) in fact Mary Moorman, but the blond, swashbuckling
  ne''er-do-well who painted the signboard affixed to a wooden post stuck in the mud
  to the southwest of the pond was hard of hearing, and his error has never been corrected.
  In any case, Mary Moorman, or Moonman, ought better be known as Marymoon Man, thus
  more appropriately named alongside her fellow witnesses Badge Man, Umbrella Man,
  Black Dog Man, and far too many more Men than we have space for here. This seems
  as good a time as any to throw in the little-known fact that alleged assassin Lee
  Harvey Oswald was interred under the name William Bobo.

  From Mary Moonman Pond, strike east, tread carefully around the Place of Strewn
  Grotesque Pebbles, and you will find yourself within spitting distance of PARACELSUS
  POND named, of course, for the 16th century alchemist Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus
  Bombastus von Hohenheim, the man whom all abecedarians hold in high honour, as among
  his coinages were both alcohol and zinc. Of more concern to us here is the way in
  which faint yet compelling links and patterns can be traced across the centuries.
  Mention has already been made of the turps tycoon Hengist Shad, whose fortune was
  based on the oleoresins exuded from coniferous trees consisting of more or less
  viscid solutions of resin in a volatile oil, and lo! we find that the very same
  turpentine was an essential constituent of Paracelsus'' celebrated weapon-salve,
  the recipe for which was as follows: Take of moss growing on the head of a thief
  who has been hanged and left in the air; of real mummy; of human blood, still warm--of
  each, one ounce; of human suet, two ounces; of linseed oil, turpentine, and Armenian
  bole -of each, two drachms. Mix all well in a mortar, and keep the salve in an oblong,
  narrow urn. [My emphasis.] The supposed linkage may seem tenuous, if it were not
  for the fact that the very next pond we stumble upon is called..

  HUMAN SUET POND. Reads like an anagram, doesn''t it? And indeed it is, for this
  is an artificial pond--obvious from its perfectly ellipsoid shape--which was dug
  in 1962 by one Thomas Pundune (anag.) to mark the publication of Richard Milhous
  Nixon''s book Six Crises. Careful study of the pond reveals half a dozen partly
  submerged plastic baubles, each of which is designed to represent one of the then
  future president''s half-dozen formative events, the most exciting of which--I refer
  to both bauble and crisis--is the "goodwill" tour of South America in 1958, when
  Nixon and his wife, the saintly Pat, were attacked and nearly killed by pro-Communist
  mobs in Venezuela. Pundune was a great admirer of the only Quaker ever to order
  the bombing of Cambodia, although he underwent his own "crisis" in 1971--the details
  are blurry, but it had something to do with a yeast infection--disavowed Nixon,
  pond and baubles, and retired to a Bewilderment Home on a bleak hillside. He may
  still be there, haunted, ancient and drooling, for all I know. But his pond remains
  a very lovely thing, and has always been popular with the picnicking element.

  Next on our fascinating tour is Pangfabuloquislinguette Pond, known colloquially
  as MUCH-DRAGGED POND as it has the distinction of being the most frequently dragged
  pond in the land. The police forces of this bailiwick--and there are at least seven
  different so-called Law Platoons who claim it as their own--all have a perplexing
  mania for sending frogmen equipped with forensically-approved nets into the pond
  at the least opportunity. Sometimes they do not even wait for a crime to be committed.
  Scarcely a week goes by without a nylon fence being erected around this splendid
  pond, a team of yellow-jacketed walkie-talkie-wielding myrmidons materialising out
  of the blue, and then a series of faint splashes as the dashing frogmen set about
  their task. Their trawls have even been productive, on occasion. The grim--or perhaps
  grimy--poisoner Gervase Tanquod was convicted on the basis of a phial of smee riddled
  with his fingerprints which he had tossed into the pond while pursued by bloodhounds.
  It proved to be the only evidence against him, yet it was--as the trial judge put
  it--"the hinge on which the case swings". (This judge, incidentally, was fond of
  ironmongery metaphors in his summings-up, and regularly invoked hinges, lever handles,
  snap hooks, latches, sealing lugs, padlocks, mobile aeration screens, safety chains,
  chink devices, transom window gears, espagnolette bolts, bevels, sash pulleys, pressed
  brackets and even fire tongs to illuminate his never less than draconian judgements.)
  Tanquod he sent to the jug for forty years, which amounted to a death sentence,
  as the fiend was already in his eighties when he was at last apprehended. Much-Dragged
  Pond has also been noteworthy as a popular location for film-makers, no doubt because
  as morning mists hang over its still surface (on those rare days it is not being
  dragged) it has a magical atmosphere, like one imagines Avalon, say, or Narnia,
  or the Blister Lane Bypass. Note too the solitary heron standing vigil at the edge
  of the pond.

  Of CLYTEMNESTRA! POND we need say nothing.

  VON PIGFLASK POND is named for Horst Helmut Von Pigflask, the noted percussionist,
  who created his own sonic universe using just a couple of biscuit tins, a thermos
  flask half-full of milk, and a few odds and ends scavenged from a rusting ship.
  "The milk," he famously declared, "must be sour, at least four days sour, or it
  has no ton, no timbre." At one time an habitue of the same Marseilles dockyard drinking
  dens as that scallywag Lothar Preen, Von Pigflask had a huge falling-out with his
  mentor on 12th October 1959. Despite both protagonists keeping voluminous--if not
  to say obsessive--diaries, neither of them has a word to say about this incident.
  Preen''s journal entry for the day is the usual vain, self-serving hyperbole, while
  Von Pigflask writes a long list of farm implements annotated with pencil-drawn symbols
  in some indecipherable private code. What can it all mean? The sad thing is that
  no one, then or now, ever really cared. On the following day, Von Pigflask hired
  a dinghy from one of his disreputable acquaintances, put out to sea, and vanished.
  Perhaps because his police files had been mislaid, his absence went unremarked;
  certainly there is no trace of him whatsoever until at some point in the late 1960s
  when reports began to circulate that he was a founder member of the blues-rock pioneers
  Blodwyn Pig. To this day the other original members, Mick Abrahams, Jack Lancaster,
  Andy Pyle and Ron Berg deny ever having heard of the great percussionist, let alone
  giving him free rein with his tins, flask and rusty flotsam on their debut album
  Ahead Rings Out. There is no doubt, however, that it was Von Pigflask himself who
  appeared unannounced on stage at the 1974 Jazz Festival in Ulm, where he performed
  a 16-second untitled improvisation before scuttling away into the tenebrous German
  twilight. Two more years passed before his triumphant return to the world stage,
  the patching up of differences with Preen, and the ear-splitting genius of his late
  work. In 1996, by now aged and suffering increasingly from the bindings, he retired
  and settled in Winnipeg. His final years were spent on the upper floors of a gleaming
  skyscraper, where he took great pleasure in his pet tortoise and worked for hours
  every day on a seemingly endless list of anagrams of Pol Pot, Ayn Rand, U Thant
  and Yoko Ono.

  STAGNANT INKY-BLACK FATHOMLESS SPOOKY POND is the thirteenth and final pond in this
  survey. How ill-named it is! Tiny ones may well flee screaming from Fiendish Pond,
  as we have seen, but not from here. On the contrary; it is not uncommon for beadles
  and matrons from the Parish Home for Poor Wretched Mud-Splattered Orphans to bring
  their charges here for an afternoon of gambol and frolic. O how the air rings with
  the joyous cries of the tots as they play pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard, sitting
  at the edge of the pond with their grubby little feet splashing in the water! How
  they gobble down their small tin bowls of custard and watercress with toothsome
  relish! If you, as an adult, dear reader, need to have your heart''s cockles warmed,
  why not join one of the regular charabanc excursions which leave from Haemoglobin
  Towers at noon every Thursday, and witness this scene for yourself? The cost is
  reasonable--not "criminally expensive" as one curmudgeon wrote in a letter to the
  Hooting Yard Bee--and if you bring your own packed lunch you can even join in the
  antics! Pray heaven that you do not give credence to that other Bee correspondent
  who wrote a farrago of nonsense about getting bats entangled in his hair! Nor ought
  you listen to malicious gossip about the pond being riddled with vivid blue poisonous
  toads. A brisk walk around the pond will soon diffuse the diesel fumes from the
  charabanc, and you will no longer have a headache.'
