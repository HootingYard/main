full_text: 'THE HORRIBLE CAVE--I

  Talk to any spelunker and you will soon learn that nobody who strays into the horrible
  cave emerges with their wits intact. Sometimes their hair turns white, they shake
  and gibber, they have to be fed with slops. Others retire to farmyards and spend
  the rest of their lives among pot-bellied pigs. Yet still the reckless and the foolhardy
  risk their sanity by ignoring the big signpost I hammered into the ground at the
  approach to the horrible cave. This is the horrible cave, reads my notice, If you
  have a shred of sense you will durst not enter. I spent quite some time on that
  wording, and ended up in hospital because I chewed the end of my pencil so fretfully
  that I contracted lead poisoning. It is by no means a pretty ailment, but I would
  much rather suffer that than the terrible derangements of those who step but once
  into the horrible cave.

  While I was in the hospital, I was visited by a government agent who was curious
  about my signpost. I suspected he was from some secret agency, for he was dressed
  in a trim black suit and did not remove his sunglasses. He had a very close-cropped
  haircut, carried an attache case which I noticed was chained to his wrist, and he
  seemed to exude the scent of frangipani or dogbane, which is often a telltale sign
  of covert operatives in my country. Standing beside the bed on which I lay splayed
  out, he introduced himself as Christopher Plummer. "Not to be confused with the
  actor who played Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun," he added hurriedly, although
  at that time the name was new to me. I have since followed the agent''s namesake''s
  career with growing interest.

  I was subjected to a series of questions about the signpost I had placed near the
  horrible cave, and answered as best as I could, given my fevered state. The agent
  made notes on a little hand-held pneumatic turbonotepad of ingenious design. I often
  find myself wondering why they never caught on. These days you are lucky to find
  one at a jumble sale or in a junk shop, luckier still if all the notes made on it
  are still readable. When Christopher Plummer had finished interrogating me in his
  strangely stiff manner, he depressed a knob on the turbopad and, with a surprisingly
  loud hiss, it clunked into hibernation mode. I watched the jet of escaping steam.

  Years later, sitting in a cafe in a tremendous town, flicking idly through an intelligence
  journal, I learned that Agent Plummer had been exposed as an alien life-form from
  some far planet riddled with horrible caves. I thought how fortunate we were to
  have only one horrible cave, terrible as it was.

  Last week I hiked out that way to see if my signpost was still there. Prancing majestically
  along the path, I encountered dozens of terrified people being attacked by cows.
  Sorry, that was a typing error. I should have said being attacked by crows. One
  poor wretch who had been pecked at was slumped beside his makeshift tent, fruitlessly
  trying to wrap a bandage around his head. I knelt down beside him and gave him a
  hand, and could not resist asking what was happening, but he was unable to speak.
  I surmised, however, that the crows must have flown from the direction of the horrible
  cave. Perhaps they nested there unbeknown to the local bird inspectors. It seemed
  like a good idea to forget about my signpost for the day and go to the headquarters
  of the bird inspection team instead, so that''s what I did.

  Although it was at least fourteen years since last I had roamed these parts, I still
  recalled the bus routes, so after making sure the pecked man''s head bandage was
  not too tight, I changed direction and cut across the moors towards the bus stop.
  It was a dismaying sight, for the shelter was in ruins, and the glass behind which
  the timetable had been pinned up was smashed and the timetable itself torn to shreds.
  Further evidence of violent crow activity, as if any were needed.

  The bus pulled up at this dismal scene a few minutes later. I clambered on board
  and became somewhat uneasy to discover that I was the only passenger. Was this going
  to be one of those frightening journeys where the driver would turn to look at me
  and I would see that he was a fiend in human form, cackling hideously as the bus
  hurtled to perdition? I had forgotten that it was Saint Eustace''s Day, and that
  most people, except for me and the bus driver and the people being attacked by crows
  would be staying indoors, in darkness, behind fastened shutters, imploring the saint
  to keep them safe from poisoned air for the coming twelvemonth. I hoped that the
  bird inspection headquarters would at least have a skeleton staff on this special
  day, and settled back in my seat, thinking to take a nap while the driver steered
  his bus around the many dangerous corners on the route.

  When will I ever learn? No sooner had I closed my eyes than the bus braked sharply,
  jolting me out of my seat. The driver cursed, for which I reprimanded him. He apologised
  for his rudery, then pointed in front of him, and I saw that the road was blocked
  by a fanatical preacher man, naked from the waist up, caked in filth, standing on
  a barrel and shouting his head off in a language I had never heard before. The driver
  and I exchanged looks of befuddlement, then he reached under his seat and hoisted
  up a rectangular tin which he opened to reveal a clotted mass of stale food. He
  invited me to share his lunch, but I declined, given that there appeared to be a
  number of weevils crawling about in it. Their presence did not bother the driver,
  who began shovelling the food into his mouth with his surprisingly dainty fingers.
  I noticed that his nails were painted with bright red lacquer, flaking off in places
  as if it had been applied some time ago. His eating habits were so repulsive that
  I turned to look out at the preacher man again. He was shouting even louder now.
  I decided to get off the bus to try and persuade him to move his barrel to the side
  of the road. As I got closer to him, I nearly jumped out of my skin. Surely I was
  mistaken? But no, there was no doubting it. Underneath all the caked muck, I recognised
  my father!

  "Papa!" I cried, sudden tears streaming down my face. I may as well have been invisible.
  He ignored me and continued to harangue the sky in his unintelligible tongue, the
  sky that was now growing black as monstrous clouds swept in from the west. I am
  tempted to lie and say that my tears were copious, but I have to confess they were
  not. I snivelled a bit and then remembered why I had got off the bus in the first
  place. It was clear to me, however, that asking my father to shift his barrel out
  of the road would be futile. I wondered how it would be if I just pushed him over
  and cleared the way myself. The laws here on toppling preacher men are draconian,
  and I would have to make sure I did not get caught. I judged that the bus driver
  was too intent on bolting his food and would not be paying attention. If he saw
  me push my pa off the barrel he would almost certainly inform on me, for we all
  know the reputation of bus company personnel, hand in hand with the police force,
  at least in this neck of the woods, for obvious historical reasons. As for my father,
  would he lay an accusation against his only son? It was a risk I had to take.

  Just as I was nerving myself for the odious deed, I was distracted by a mordant
  fancy which had been nestling dormant in my brain until that moment. I am utterly
  perplexed as to why it suddenly uncoiled itself, as it were, and sprang to the forefront
  of my mind, casting out all other thoughts. It was a vision--so very vivid!--of
  myself dressed in rags, exhaustedly swinging a leper bell from my withered arm.

  Weird, that. I slapped myself on the forehead a couple of times to dispel the hallucination,
  came to my senses, yanked my father''s ankle so that he fell off the barrel, pushed
  the barrel over and rolled it to the kerb, and got back on the bus. The driver had
  finished his lunch, so, swerving slightly to avoid my father, who was sat in the
  road dusting himself down, he drove me to my stop ten minutes walk from the bird
  inspection unit. What I found there was brain-dizzying.

  NOTA BENE : Younger readers should note that this piece first appeared as long ago
  as 2004. There are two further episodes, which will be posted in the next couple
  of days.


  THE HORRIBLE CAVE : PART TWO

  I arrived at the Bird Inspectors'' Hut to discover that it had been engulfed by
  a tsunami and lay in ruins. A solitary moorhen was paddling about where the door
  used to be, but there was no sign of the inspectors. I fancied that perhaps this
  might be a talking moorhen which could apprise me where they had gone, and asked
  my question in a slow, clear, loud voice, as one might use in speaking to a recalcitrant
  infant. But of course the moorhen was incapable of speech! What was I thinking?

  I felt it more important than ever to track down at least one of the bird inspectors
  and relay my theory that crows were nesting in the horrible cave, with alarming
  consequences. In my experience, most bird inspectors sport Italianate mustachios
  and preen them fanatically with oils and waxes, so I decided to head off on foot
  for the nearest village and seek out a shop selling oils, waxes, and other hair
  treatments.

  I was in luck, for as soon as I strode purposefully into the village I saw not only
  such an emporium, tucked between a wholesaler of dinghies and a clapboard hovel,
  but a man with Italianate mustachios lurking in the doorway. He was sopping wet,
  making his moustache droop, but that made it all the more likely he had been caught
  in the tsunami.

  I hailed him from a distance of some forty feet. That is the last thing I can remember.
  I have no idea what happened from that moment until today, three weeks later so
  I am told, when I found myself sitting in an armchair staring out at a dying lawn,
  being proffered cups of tea and mashed potatoes by an oversolicitous nurse. Her
  name, she told me, was Primrose. That name rang a faint bell in my memory. I associated
  it with something petrifying and terrible, but Primrose the nurse seemed to be neither.
  In fact her fawning was getting on my nerves.

  I wanted to ask her where I was and how I got here, but she had already skipped
  off to fetch more potatoes. Deciding to follow her, I walked rather unsteadily into
  a corridor. It was painted a hideous shade of orange, and on the walls hung framed
  portraits of members of Jethro Tull, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and Barclay James
  Harvest. Was this some kind of benighted prog rock haven? I should add that these
  were paintings rather than photographs, although perhaps the word I am looking for
  is daubs. My infant child could do better, if I had an infant child, but I do not.
  Long ago I vowed never to bring a new being into a world with a horrible cave in
  it, lest the mite should accidentally wander into it. I could not forgive myself
  if such a thing happened.

  I could hear what sounded like potatoes being mashed coming from an open doorway
  over to my left. Entering the room, however, I did not find Primrose. Instead I
  was confronted by a slobbering ghoul. It spoke--or rather, groaned--at me in Latin,
  for it was a Vatican ghoul. Atop its gruesome head I could see the tattered remnants
  of a biretta, in which a number of locusts seemed to be feeding. Were they eating
  the ghoul''s straggly locks, or its priestly hat? Or both? I was so fascinated by
  the locusts that I am afraid I paid little attention to the gravel-voiced Latin
  being spouted at me. At this point Primrose came in.

  "There you are, Mr MacTavish!" she cooed sweetly, addressing the ghoul, "I''ve been
  looking all over for you. It''s time for your mashed potato poultice. Come with
  me, there''s a dear." She took it by what I can only assume was its arm and steered
  it away, still groaning. I was rather disconcerted that Primrose had ignored me
  completely. Perhaps I was being oversensitive. I looked at my wristwatch and saw
  that it was just coming up to midday. Why in heaven''s name was I dressed in pyjamas?
  I opened a cupboard and rummaged around until I found a shiny and brand new boiler
  suit. I changed into it and checked how I looked in a mirror, noting that its broad
  black and yellow hoops gave me a faint resemblance to a giant bee. It was time to
  leave this place, wherever it was. I pranced out onto the lawn and peered around,
  looking for a signpost.

  I have always been fond of crocuses, and there was a clump of them nearby. In the
  absence of a signpost, I decided I could do worse than tarry awhile examining their
  flowers and leaves, and perhaps scrubbling in the soil to have a quick look at the
  corm. One should take one''s pleasures as one can, and if I was to stride onward
  with a spring in my step, a few minutes'' contemplation of foliage would calm my
  brain for the inevitable travails ahead. These were early crocuses, or Crocus tommasinianus,
  as no doubt the ghoul could have told me. I wondered whereabouts on his grisly frame
  Primrose the nurse was going to apply that poultice of hers. His head? That spindly
  arm? I wondered, too, how she would cope with the locusts, who would devour the
  mashed potato as quickly as she could apply it.

  Thus lost in thoughts of potatoes, ghouls and crocuses, I failed to notice that
  a man had approached me, all but silently.

  "Good day to you, sir," he said, clearing accumulated phlegm from his throat as
  he did so, "Would I be correct in thinking you know something of the horrible cave?"

  I looked up, astonished, and saw that my interlocutor was none other than the so
  called limping irredentist, Florenzio Pabstus.


  "THIS MEDICINE HAS EXCELLENT EFFECT IN HYSTERIC..."

  "This Medicine has excellent Effect in Hysteric Fits, and in all that Train of Symptoms
  which Hysteric and Hypochondriac Persons are subject to; such as Risings in the
  Throat threatning Suffocation, difficult Breathing, Flutterings and Palpitations
  of the Heart, frequent Fainting, Lowness of Spirits, violent Pains in the Head,
  Languor of the whole Body, Dullness of the Mind and Senses, with constant Anxieties
  and Inquietude, &c. The Dose must be repeated according to the urgency of the Symptoms;
  and the Medicine must be continued some Time after the Complaints disappear, to
  prevent a Relapse. It will be serviceable during the Use of the AETHER, especially
  in Case of Costiveness, to take at proper Intervals a gentle Purge, such as Tinctura
  Sacra, Pill Rufi, Rhubarb, or Glauber''s Salts. Bodily Exercise of all sorts contributes
  greatly to the Cure of these Complaints, especially Riding on Horseback." -- Matthew
  Turner, An Account of the Extraordinary Medicinal Fluid, Called Aether


  CLANDESTINE DEFIBRILLATION UNIT

  I work for a clandestine defibrillation unit. They call me Lars. My real name is
  Odo, but they call me Lars because we are clandestine. I have what some consider
  a grandiose hat. My parents had a hat shop, called Hats of Grandiosity, and they
  gave me this hat when I left home. I did not wish to be part of the hat trade, much
  to my parents'' consternation. On my eleventh birthday, a tad precociously, I announced
  that I saw my future in the world of clandestine defibrillation.

  "Odo," said my parents, simultaneously, "You have our blessing." They always spoke
  at the same time, using identical words and vocal inflections. It was uncanny. I
  grew up thinking all married couples were like that, and it came as something of
  a shock when I got married myself, to the delightful Zelda, and discovered that
  not only did we not speak alike, we did not think alike, at all. Zelda''s preoccupations
  were putty, dreadnoughts and the Boxer Rising, subjects of very little interest
  to me. I did make some attempt to show an interest in putty, but my wife grew impatient
  with my hamfisted flapping, like a seal on an ice floe. After six months, she decamped
  to Tantarabim with a post office worker who wore brilliantine in his hair and shared
  her passion for putty.

  I was distraught, of course, and considered pursuing her to plight my troth, but
  in the clandestine defibrillation business the devil takes the hindmost. We had
  just received a document imploring us to wreak our tiptop skills in an abandoned
  birdcage factory on the banks of the old dried-up river in Pointy Town. My supervisor,
  who not only looked like but had the very same name as Tuesday Weld, said to me,
  "Lars, I know your wife has run off with a brilliantined putty enthusiast, but this
  job is decisively important. If we crack it, we will be hailed throughout the world
  of clandestine defibrillation units. The grandiosity of our reputation will match
  that of your hat."

  I could not argue with that. Indeed, I could never argue with Tuesday Weld. So off
  we went in our jeep, terrifying small domestic animals as we sped screeching along
  the narrow and dangerous roads to Pointy Town. The citizenry had put out flags to
  welcome us, even though they knew we were clandestine. Tuesday Weld was furious,
  more furious than I had ever seen her. Not even when her pencil sharpener was mislaid
  by a Tasmanian duck doctor was she so furious.

  "Remove those flags!" she cried, jumping from the jeep. The rest of us skulked into
  the birdcage factory and defibrillated it, clandestinely. Then Tuesday Weld took
  us to the Pointy Town bistro and bought us cake. I chose a chocolate swiss roll.


  DOBSON''S DECLARATION

  We think of Dobson primarily as a pamphleteer, albeit an out-of-print one. His occasional
  forays into public speaking, lecturing, and, it has to be said, jabbering like a
  man who has lost his marbles, are thus often overlooked. A new paper by Aloysius
  Nestingbird*= attempts to set this right. I say "attempts" because in my view Nestingbird
  has been spectacularly unsuccessful. Reading his verbose twaddle gave me a splitting
  headache after the first couple of paragraphs, and I went to have a lie down in
  a darkened room. As I lay on my pallet, I took pleasure in recalling my great enmity
  for Nestingbird. Verily, I thought to myself, staring at patches of badly-applied
  paint on the ceiling, he is a detestable old fool who would be better off inspecting
  the bed of a slimy pond than writing articles about Dobson. The fact that I am even
  older than Nestingbird is irrelevant.

  As soon as various sensory globules in my cranium had stopped pulsating, I returned
  to my desk and ploughed on through the article. Unlike its author, I am conscientious,
  and I had promised to review it for this website, for my usual fee of a tin of plum
  tomatoes and a new cravat with which I can cut a dash.

  Nestingbird focuses his attention on Dobson''s famous Declaration, which the pamphleteer
  delivered on a sopping wet Tuesday in March in the year of Nicholas Ray''s film
  Bigger Than Life, in which James Mason memorably goes bonkers on cortisone and announces
  "God was wrong!" in one of Hollywood''s finest moments. I wish I could say that
  the film and Dobson''s Declaration had some definite connection. The trouble is
  that the only record of what he said that day, standing next to a gleaming puddle
  in the bailiwick of Thrombosis Magna, is the text Marigold Chew inscribed on the
  back of a toffee apple wrapper the next day. As you can see in the reproduction
  below, even magnified as it is, her writing is far too tiny to be read by the average
  human eye, or mine at any rate.


  This is doubly frustrating, as we have to take the wretched Nestingbird''s word
  on trust--pah!--when he asserts that the entire Declaration was nothing more than
  a garbled account of Dobson dropping his bus pass down a crevasse and obtaining
  a replacement from a kiosk infested with bats.

  Now I am going to go and lie down again, to await my tomatoes and cravat.

  "HELIOGABALUS MADE ELABORATE PREPARATIONS FOR HIS OWN..."

  "Heliogabalus made elaborate preparations for his own death, expecting that it would
  come in the midst of some uprising. He had a courtyard in his palace paved with
  porphyry so that he might throw himself down on it from a high place. He had a steel
  dagger fitted with a diamond-studded, carved gold hilt, to stab himself. He had
  especially spun a rope of gold and silk, to strangle himself. Surprised in the latrine
  by his assassins, he choked himself to death on the sponge that, to use Montaigne''s
  expression, ''the Romans used to wipe their behinds''." -- Alexandre Dumas, in the
  preface to his Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine.


  "A MAN, A PLAN, A CANOE, PASTA,..."

  "A man, a plan, a canoe, pasta, heros, rajahs, a coloratura, maps, snipe, percale,
  macaroni, a gag, a banana bag, a tan, a tag, a banana bag again, or: a camel, a
  crepe, pins, spam, a rut, a Rolo, cash, a jar, sore hats, a peon, a canal -- Panama!"
  -- palindrome attributed to Guy Steele'
