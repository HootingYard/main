full_text: 'NOTES ON JELLYFISH

  There came a time when Marigold Chew, growing exasperated by Dobson''s listlessness,
  encouraged him to get involved in amateur dramatics. The out-of-print pamphleteer
  formed a group entitled the Jellyfish Players, and issued a prospectus, hoping to
  gain bookings in various derelict seaside theatres during the winter months.

  The company''s first production was Strange And Poisonous Aquatic Beings, a loose
  adaptation of ex-hostage Brian Keenan''s book An Evil Cradling. In Dobson''s hands,
  out went the Celtic, bardic posturing, the romanticised vision of an intense poetic
  response to a terrible ordeal, and in came gnomic, baffling speeches which appeared
  to have more to do with life on the ocean floor than with a claustrophobic Beirut
  cellar. The production closed after two nights, and Dobson and his cohorts were
  chased out of town by an enraged groupuscule called the Children Of Hibernia, fanatical
  mystics who had acclaimed the bearded figure of Keenan as their prophet.

  Back home, Marigold Chew tried to point out to Dobson the gravity of his miscalculations,
  and had him read many stupendous tomes on dramatic theory. She was not aware, however,
  that in the middle of the night, by torchlight, Dobson was devouring Victorian melodramas
  and French farces by the dozen.

  The following winter, somehow managing to commandeer an end-of-the-pier playhouse
  in Vug-By-The-Sea, the Jellyfish Players unveiled a four-hour show entitled My Plankton
  Theory. Dobson''s foolish friend Boloslav Carnegieguggenheim had a hand in the playscript,
  which one critic described as "outright gibberish". When the players took to the
  stage for the first night, dressed up to the nines in hand-sewn lobster costumes,
  they were disconcerted by the audience, which reacted to the broad, knockabout comedy
  as if it were the most harrowing of tragedies. Several theatregoers in the front
  row sat sobbing, convulsed by grief, and one eyewitness told the local newspaper
  that there was gnashing of teeth and rending of garments in the upper circle.

  Despite this misunderstanding of his intentions, Dobson kept the show running for
  eleven months, even when nobody actually turned up to watch. Only when he was hospitalised
  following a mishap with a drenched and disorientated trumpeter swan did the play
  close. By the time he recovered, Dobson had become so obsessed with his investigations
  into the fatal Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash that he abandoned his dramatic ambitions
  for evermore, and his amanuensis Marigold Chew made no attempt to revive them. Instead,
  she devoted her energies to potato gardening, and was awarded many, many glittering
  prizes.


  DOBSON''S LEECH MISHAP

  Dobson was one of the few pamphleteeers of the 20th century who still took seriously
  the mediaeval theory of the Four Bodily Humours. To remind readers who have forgotten,
  and inform those who don''t know, here is a commendably concise paragraph from "Humorous"
  Dobson, an unpublished essay by Marigold Chew:

  Taking the Aristotelian elements in turn, the theory was as follows: earth is reflected
  in the body as black bile, air as yellow bile, fire as blood, and water as phlegm.
  From these derive the terms melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. Dobson
  never deviated from his belief that the theory was fundamentally correct. He tended
  towards melancholy.

  And, it should be said, he was so convinced that he also subscribed to the related
  practice of bloodletting with leeches. Dobson was rarely ill, but when he was, he
  had a devil of a time trying to find a doctor who would treat him as he wished.
  On his 61st birthday, suffering from an excess of black bile, he was in luck--or
  so he thought. An "alternative therapist" had opened their doors just down the road.
  Dobson presented himself and demanded leeching. He was shown into a back room and
  lo!, leeches were applied to his spindly legs. Unfortunately, the quack used leeches
  of the genus Helobdella (Glossiphoniidae), rather than Hirudo medicinalis. The latter
  is, as its name implies, the medicinal leech. It is a quaint, dark cylinder which
  has thirty three body rings, five pairs of eyes, several pairs of testes and two
  suckers, one at each end of its body. The head sucker searches and penetrates while
  the tail sucker holds fast to the host.

  The result of the wrong type of leech being used was so vile that I shall not repeat
  it here. Dobson was lucky to survive, but he did, thank the Lord. If you decide
  to have your blood sucked by leeches, take this helpful anatomical diagram of Hirudo
  medicinalis with you. You will be able to check that your practicioner is using
  the correct type of leech, and can rest easy.



  HOW THE QUOTATIONS ARE SELECTED

  A number of readers have asked me how I choose the quotations with which each Hooting
  Yard bulletin begins. I wish it was as simple as saying "I browse through books
  and find a sentence or paragraph that tickles my fancy", for who among us does not
  like having their fancy tickled? In truth, the process is hideously complicated.

  When I developed the initial concept for this website towards the end of last year,
  covering page after page of a big writing tablet with notes, diagrams, graphs, squiggles
  and, it must be said, the occasional savage doodle born of fractiousness, it seemed
  to me that mere whim was an unacceptable way of making the selection. After all,
  the rest of the content adheres to a system--albeit a deep system--and so should
  the quotations. I therefore designed an Oulipian constraint to govern my choices.
  Careful study of the quotations will thus reveal that there is a profound logic
  at work determining which words, by which author, are excerpted at any particular
  point on the calendar.

  So abstruse is the scheme that the launch of Hooting Yard, which ought to have taken
  place in October 2003, was delayed until mid-December. I spent six or seven weeks
  devising the system, having cast aside the original writing tablet and obtained
  a fresh one just to work on what I code-named, like a military adventure, Operation
  Quote-of-the-Day For The Hooting Yard Website, or OQOTDFTHYW for short. Without
  wishing to lay bare the rules by which the system operates, I think it is worth
  pointing out that today, for example, being the tenth of November, the title of
  the book cited includes the word poise, and the extract itself consists of four
  sentences, two of which refer to an apparatus designed to deflect rainfall.


  THE GOD WITH PAWS

  There is a tribe of people who dwell beyond Those Purple Hills who worship a god
  with paws. It has no other name, or at least not one that is ever spoken aloud by
  the members of the tribe, nor written down, for they do not write as we would understand
  the term. The god with paws apparently forbids any image to be made of it, so we
  have no idea what it looks like. How many paws does it have? How tall is it? Does
  it have just one head, or many? What living creature does it resemble, if any? We
  do not know the answers to any of these questions, for the tribespeople are unwilling
  or unable to answer them. For the same reason, it is futile to quiz them about the
  part played in their culture by the god with paws, for they grow mute, or--the chatterboxes
  among them--change the subject, or simply wander away to check their stockpiles
  of macadamia nuts.

  There has been some conjecture that by worshipping a "god with paws", the tribespeople
  imply the existence of other gods--the god with hooves, perhaps, or the god with
  flippers--but no hard evidence has come to light.

  The god with paws inhabits a hut on the edge of the tribe''s village. No one is
  allowed within a certain distance of it, but at sunset each day, everyone gathers
  in a circle around the hut and stares at it in rapt, if somewhat ill-tempered, silence.
  It is thought that the people are given instructions by the god with paws, communicated
  in some unknown extrasensory manner, but the nature of these commands, and whether
  or not the people take a blind bit of notice of them, is unclear.

  I have knitted myself a pair of paw-like mittens and intend to impersonate the god
  of paws, just to see what happens. I will let you know.


  CRISIS IN THE SEDGE

  Occasionally, if you observe closely, it is possible to watch a crisis developing
  in a clump of sedge. On any given day, the crisis may involve sedge warblers* (a
  type of bird), but is unlikely to match the features of any of the Six Crises examined
  by Richard Milhous Nixon in his 1962 book of that title.

  Sedge crises tend to be riverbanky by definition, so in addition to the aforementioned
  sedge warblers, one may also find that otters, frogs or hand-carved wooden decoy
  ducks are involved. In the case of frogs, it is advisable to make tape recordings
  of their croaks. These can then be analysed at leisure, back in the comfort of one''s
  laboratory, attended by Mungo the disfigured factotum. It is not recommended to
  make recordings of any quacks which seem to have the decoy ducks as their source,
  as these are of course utterly fraudulent and many hours diligent lab time will
  be wasted as a result. If one has to pay rental for the laboratory space, this can
  be financially ruinous, thus compromising one''s ability to resolve a sedge crisis,
  in some instances fatally.

  Note that most common sedge crises can be dealt with quite effectively by the amateur,
  and the whole thing should blow over within a week. Special patrol units, dedicated
  to this type of work, ought to be called in if the crisis lasts longer. Telephone
  numbers for more than a dozen such teams can be found in the Directory of Sedge
  Crisis Resources, available by mail order. Unfortunately, there are some impostors
  who prey on the naive and the credulous. Genuine crisis teams will always, always
  wear caps with ear-flaps.

  As soon as possible after the sedge crisis has been dealt with, a full written report,
  in the international standard format, must be submitted to the authorities. This
  is a legal requirement, and failure to comply will result in criminal charges and
  deportation to a secret facility disguised as a cream cracker factory, where the
  malefactor will be poked at with forks and bashed on the head with a big iron utensil.


  * NOTE : Even if one is dealing with a warblerless sedge crisis, it is important
  to learn to recognise these birds so that they can be discounted from one''s considerations.
  Above is a picture of a sedge warbler, by clicking on which one will be able to
  hear what the damned thing sounds like. Hooting Yard is grateful to the always-exciting
  Latvian Birding website for this warbling.


  FIVE YEARS AGO

  Exactly five years ago today, these words were posted in Hooting Yard:

  "Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. Remember,
  too, the case of the distressed pig, solved by Special Agent Blot. The distressed
  pig was found in a rowing boat crossing Tantarabim Lake. Agent Blot swam out to
  it and fed it with nutritious cake. As the pig grew becalmed Agent Blot took the
  oars and he rowed to the mud-splattered shore. He hoisted the pig right out of the
  boat and bedded it down in some straw. Then he plodded his way in his wellington
  boots to the pig farmer''s hut down the lane, and he felled the brute with a thwack
  of his fist and bound him up with a chain. Agent Blot dragged the pig farmer off
  to the prison, bang in the centre of town. And that is why, on November the fifth,
  the distressed pig did not drown."

  I am pleased to report that the tale so briefly told has been expanded, by bestselling
  paperbackist Pebblehead no less, into a thumping great airport bookstall paperback
  potboiler entitled Special Agent Blot And The Distressed Pig! : How A Distressed
  Pig Was Rescued By Special Agent Blot!

  It seems Pebblehead is still managing to avoid the attentions of a copy editor.
  Those exclamation marks in the title are wholly uncalled-for. Obviously he is trying
  to drum up excitement in the casual airport bookstall browser, but surely he realises
  that the name "Pebblehead" alone, emblazoned in glittery glittering glitz upon the
  cover, is enough to cause perilous palpitations in the hardest of hearts?

  SMOOCHING WITH ISTVAN

  Many, many women, and not a few men, have their stories of the time they smooched
  with Istvan. Their recollections have been anthologised in a new book, entitled
  Smooching With Istvan, in which they reminisce about their smooching. One of those
  whose memories are not included is alleged Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, who
  is known to have smooched with Istvan in a Fort Worth, Texas nightclub early in
  1963, soon after his return from the Soviet Union. His, there, refers to Oswald,
  not Istvan, although Istvan had himself visited the USSR (or, in Cyrillic, the CCCP)
  on many occasions, smooching with Olga, Natasha, Yuri, Boris and Svetlana, among
  others.

  It has to be said that most of these tales are mundane, boring, even unreadable.
  From time to time, however, the diligent reader comes upon a nugget of splendour,
  such as this brief passage from an unnamed resident of the Land Adjunct To The Frightening
  Sea:

  "Titlarks sang, German lieder singers gathered, petunias and hellebore were in bloom,
  and a new DVD of William Betty : The Young Roscius was at last available in the
  shops. I pootled off to the dancehall planning little more than an evening of glum
  pinch-mouthed misery. But Istvan was there! I smooched with him for two hours. His
  cravat was so, so dashing. Now as I sit in my beach hut peering intently at auks
  and terns through my binoculars, I think of that night, and my heart pounds with
  something which may well be excitement."

  Copies of Smooching With Istvan are not yet available, as they have been impounded
  by shadowy figures wearing tunics woven from thousands upon thousands of hairs plucked
  from pipistrelle bats.
