full_text: 'HINGED, UNHINGED, OR NEITHER?

  The quandary that beset Dennis, apart from his conviction that in a previous life
  he was Veronica Lake, was whether he was hinged or unhinged, or possibly neither.
  Most of us would not fret about such a thing, but Dennis did. There is a temptation
  to say that this fact in itself proves that Dennis was indeed unhinged, and to ponder
  why this had not occurred to him. But it had, and it added to his fretfulness. For
  there was so much about Dennis that was hinged. For example, when he chanced upon
  poisonous toads, he scampered out of their way, rather than picking them up and
  taking them home, as an unhinged person might.

  Dennis was adept at self-preservation in a very hinged way. When he plunged out
  of an aircraft at high altitude, without a parachute, he made sure that he lit upon
  an air current that allowed him to drift easily onto a bank of fresh-fallen snow,
  thus cushioning his landing and meaning that he only spent six weeks in hospital
  instead of being coffined up and buried in that Baltimore churchyard where lie the
  remains of Edgar Allan Poe.

  Dennis had given much thought to the idea that he might be neither hinged nor unhinged,
  not in the sense that he fell somewhere in between, but that hingedness or its opposite
  was foreign to him, as an igloo to a Maori, or a biro to a caveman. Dennis remembered,
  in addition to being Veronica Lake, being a caveman. The gulf of thousands of years
  between these lives was a blank, however, and Dennis wondered if he had spent all
  that time in some kind of limbo. If he had, where was that limbo, and had he been
  hinged or unhinged, or neither, while trapped in it? This seemed to Dennis so monumental
  a question that he could find no rest.

  Dennis needs your help. In particular, he needs your shoes. All of them. If Dennis''
  story has tugged at your heart-strings, please, please parcel up all your footwear
  and send the package to Dennis, c/o The Veronica Lake Building, Winnipeg. Thank
  you.


  I SAW THREE SHIPS

  I saw three ships come sailing in, but what did I care about ships? I wasn''t hanging
  around in the dockyards because I wanted to look at ships. I am an entomologist,
  and I was here to trap boll weevils. I watched them scuttling out of sacks of flour
  being unloaded from one of the three ships, so I pounced on them with my nylon boll
  weevil net, and ferried them back to my lab.

  I cackled as I assembled my equipment. How they glistened, my pincers and knives
  and scalpels and clamps and suction tubes and Petri dishes! Pulling on my lab coat,
  the white starched cotton splattered here and there with the blood of insects, I
  scampered like an excited puppy over to the Dansette and put on my favourite Ronnie
  Milsap LP. I like to listen to country music as I dissect boll weevils.

  I was just sharpening one of my scalpels when the door of the lab burst open. Cursing
  that I had forgotten to lock it, I span round to find myself confronted by a trio
  of heavily-armed thugs. They were, to a man, huge, very frightening, and togged
  out in futuristic Robocop-like uniforms. Their helmets had been burnished to a gleam
  that I could only envy.

  "Drop the scalpel, pigdog!" shouted one of them, loud enough to be heard over Ronnie
  Milsap. I froze, but managed to let the blade fall from my hand. It clattered on
  the linoleum. I do not approve of carpets or rugs in an insect laboratory.

  A second thug snatched up from my work-bench the canvas bag in which I had put the
  boll weevils. He lifted the visor from his helmet and looked at me with snarling
  contempt. When he spoke, I was disconcerted by the fluting gentility of his tone.

  "Never, ever, trap boll weevils as they scuttle out of our flour sacks on the dockside
  when three ships come sailing in," he said.

  Crushed and piteous, I began to mumble something, but he waved a gauntleted hand
  at me, and interrupted.

  "If we ever catch you abducting our boll weevils again, we will do something unimaginably
  horrible to you," he said, "So be warned."

  And with that, the three thugs swept out of the lab, slamming the door behind them.
  I took a napkin from my pocket and mopped my brow. I was shaking. Ronnie Milsap
  was singing. It was on the very same day that David Blunkett resigned as the Home
  Secretary.

  THE LEGEND OF THE GRUNTY MAN

  Now children, settle down your sleepy heads, and remember you must be good, because
  you know what happens to naughty children, don''t you?

  What happens, ma?

  Why, the Grunty Man comes to get them, of course!

  Oooooooh.

  He comes bounding down from the dark terrible hills to snatch bad boys and girls
  away!

  But how does the Grunty Man get in, ma?

  He makes his grunty noise, three times, and all the doors and windows of the house
  just pop open like that!

  Oooooooh. What does he look like?

  Nobody who the Grunty Man snatches away ever, ever comes back, so nobody can say
  what he looks like, children.

  Where does he take them, ma?

  He snatches them from their beds and tucks them under his arms and he bounds away
  with them up into the dark terrible hills and then he makes them work in his big
  furnace in a grim black cave where he makes his grunty noise at them all day and
  all night and it is so loud and horrible that birds fall out of the sky if they
  hear it... Are you fast asleep now, little ones?

  Not yet, ma. Tell us more about the Grunty Man.

  The Grunty Man is ten thousand years old, and even huge bears and bison and squid
  and creepy crawlies and weasels and fierce wild animals are frightened of him.

  Does he snatch away bad animals too, ma?

  Yes he does, and he keeps them in cages and sets them on the bad children when they
  don''t work hard enough in his terrible belching furnace in the cave.

  Oooooooh. What is there to eat in the cave?

  The Grunty Man makes special cakes and buns to feed the naughty children, poisonous
  cakes and buns, with flies hovering over them, and no icing.

  No icing at all? Are they like fairy cakes?

  They are, children, but poisonous fairy cakes. And they taste horrible!

  Eeeeuuurrgghh. We would be sick.

  You would be very sick. But you would never die, because the Grunty Man would keep
  you working at the furnace. Clang clang clang. Imagine the giant anvils and red
  hot bellows. That is what lies in store for you if you are bad children and do not
  fall asleep right now, tucked up under your soft eiderdowns.

  We understand ma, for we are the spawn of the Grunty Man and he has sent us to menace
  you and haunt your every waking moment for as long as you shall live!


  PETROCHEMICAL SHIVER-ME-TIMBERS CONCLAVE

  Rookie pirates aboard container ships need to watch their backs. As a seaside doctor,
  I cannot count the number of cases I''ve had of youngsters fresh from their first
  sea voyage coming to me with cutlass wounds or, worse, lead pellets from a blunderbuss
  embedded in their crania, dangerously close to the brain.

  One such lad was Rufus Farjeon, who ran away to sea when he was just seven. He ran
  from his parents'' gingerbread cottage all the way to the beach, panting, panting,
  and he swam out to a container ship moored on the horizon and clambered aboard,
  and in his tiny squeak of a voice he said to the captain "Rufus Farjeon, aged nine,
  reporting for duty, cap''n!"

  Captain Cack was not taken in by the boy''s lying about his age, but he placed an
  avuncular hand on Farjeon''s shoulder and quizzed him on his knowledge of obscure
  marine imponderabilities. The captain''s right hand was the avuncular one. His left
  hand was withered.

  Over the next few weeks, young Farjeon scrubbed the decks, sloshed out nautical
  buckets, polished the railings to a gleam, and learned all there was to know about
  bells at sea. He also sat at Captain Cack''s breakfast table, reading aloud to the
  old sea dog from Yoko Ono''s book Grapefruit, while the captain ate plentiful toast,
  hard tack biscuits and, by coincidence, halves of grapefruit.

  Then, one Thursday some weeks into the voyage, the blond and brilliantined bo''sun
  took the boy aside as he trundled a clattering barrel through a narrow passage between
  containers.

  "A word of warning," muttered the bo''sun, in tones of menace, "At eight bells the
  captain is holding a petrochemical shiver-me-timbers conclave in his cabin. There
  may be trouble. Watch your back."

  But Rufus Farjeon, who had celebrated his eighth birthday a week ago, was by now
  puffed up, preening and reckless, and he ignored the bo''sun''s words. Reeking of
  grog and blinded by the pitiless tropical sun, he behaved at the conclave in a foolhardy
  manner, so angering a bloodthirsty corsair that he was taken to the poop deck and
  shot in the head.

  And thus he turned up in my seaside surgery a few days later. I bandaged his wounds
  and prescribed a course of Doctor Wainwright''s Brain Pills. I well knew that just
  one pill was enough to stun an ostrich, and I had the lad on twenty of them a day,
  for his metabolism was inhuman. I needed to find out if he was a changeling. He
  was. And now he sits like a little potentate on a throne on the jetty, facing out
  to sea, his bandages discarded and his eyes aglow, and mermaids come to gawp at
  him, and minnows swim in ribbons at his feet, for he is Triton now, and will always
  be, throned, festooned with seaweed, and staring out to sea.


  CHRISTMAS DINNER

  Here is a recipe for your Christmas dinner, if you are planning on having one. It
  is taken from Dobson''s pamphlet Some Things To Eat In The Bleak Midwinter.


  Boiled Cormorant A La Dobson (for Malachy O''Neill)

  This is a splendid and satisfying dish, easy to prepare, highly nutritious, and
  the enemy of indigestion. First, ensure your kitchen is free of verminous creeping
  things with hundreds of legs, suckers and antennae. Root them out and exterminate
  them. Gather the tiny corpses, place them in a paper bag, seal the bag with glue,
  carry it out of the house, and set fire to it. Do not go back indoors until every
  last speck has been consumed by the terrible flames. Now, back in the kitchen, take
  off your windcheater and your big black boots and wash your hands with carbolic
  soap. Cover your hairstyle, if you have one, with a clean rag fixed in place by
  an elastic band. You are ready to begin.

  Take a freshly-slaughtered cormorant and place it on your work-surface. Vegetarians
  can substitute the bird with a pretend cormorant modelled in marzipan. I will not
  remind you of this point again. Pluck all the feathers off and put them in a grinder.
  Grind them to fine powder, and, using a funnel, pour the powder into a spare cruet.
  If there is a ring around the cormorant''s neck, as there will be if it has been
  exploited by fisherfolk, carefully remove the ring and throw it away, unless it
  is old and decorative, in which case you may wish to pop it in an envelope and send
  it to Antiques Roadshow veteran Hugh Scully. But do that later, on Boxing Day.

  Step two. Boil the cormorant.

  While the bird is simmering away, prepare the sauce. Chop up into tiny bits four
  pomegranates, a plum, lots and lots of potatoes, sixteen bananas, another cormorant,
  some toffee apples and a choc ice. Place the tiny bits in a bowl and stir thoroughly,
  then get the funnel again and pour the contents of the bowl into the grinder. Adjust
  the setting to "moderately violent grinding" and switch it on for no more than ten
  seconds. Transfer back into the bowl. Add water up to the brim and stir. Do not
  on any account use tap water. You will ruin the recipe and end up with a bowl of
  inedible sludge unless you use the fantastically pure spring water drawn from the
  Mysterious Old Well at Pointy Town.

  Drain any remaining water from the pan with the boiled cormorant in it, and tip
  the contents of the bowl in, making sure you do so in one swift movement. Ideally,
  it should sound like this--gloop gloop gloop...gloop. Now put the bowl down somewhere,
  bring the pan back to the boil and allow to simmer while you fry the cocktail sausages.
  They should be almost, but not quite, black.

  You are nearly done. Take a large oval platter and make a bed of shredded lettuce,
  chives, spring onions, porridge oats, cream crackers and mayonnaise. Have another
  look around the kitchen to make sure no creepy-crawlies have appeared from any unhatched
  eggs you may have overlooked earlier.

  Turn off the heat, and transfer the boiled cormorant and sauce on to the platter.
  Use a clean dishcloth to wipe around the edges in case any of the sauce is dribbling
  over the side. Take a Swiss Army knife out of your pocket, extract the sharpest
  blade, and, just in case the last time you used it was to dislodge a pebble from
  the sole of your boot, plunge it into boiling water to sterilise it. Very carefully
  slice the blade across the cormorant, as deep as you can, and put the knife down.
  Insert the cocktail sausages into the bird, then sew up the slit with edible butcher''s
  string.

  Try to remember where you left the spare cruet, and sprinkle the powdered cormorant
  feathers evenly over the dish. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve.


  THE CARDBOARD CLUB

  The Cardboard Club was an odd little society which met in the vicinity of Bodger''s
  Spinney during the last century. Some say that it still does so, although the evidence
  for this is slight. Throughout its existence it was difficult to pin it down, to
  attest with any certainty who its members were and what they did, so those who claim
  its continuance into the new millennium may indeed be correct. I have just noticed
  a hornets'' nest in my rafters.

  We do know that the members of the Cardboard Club were fond of regalia. Several
  crates and trunks packed with badges, emblems, tassels, embroidery, pennants, flags
  and suchlike were discovered during excavation works on the Blister Lane Bypass
  a couple of years ago. Catalogued with care by that prematurely white-haired, mute
  and pallid man at the museum, the collection provides some clues as to the activities
  of the Cardboard Club.

  For example, it seems reasonably clear that the chief purpose of the club was to
  collect samples of cardboard. Collect, note, not disperse. What is not yet understood
  is why this was blanketed in secrecy. After all, cardboard is no longer illegal
  in my country, nor are there any punitive taxes levied upon the possession of it.
  The mystery deepens when we consider that no cardboard whatsoever was found with
  the crates of regalia. One can only assume that the club''s cardboard collection
  was squirrelled away.

  The most intriguing item to be found was a toy plasticine model of Beaky, from the
  sixties beat group Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich. A safety pin attached to
  his plasticine spinal column suggests that it was worn as a signal of honour, perhaps
  by the Plenipotentiary Grand Vizier of the Cardboard Club. Alternatively, it may
  have found its way into the crate by accident, and have nothing to do with the club
  at all. This line of inquiry is well worth pursuing, but not now, because the frantic
  buzzing of those hornets is driving me crackers, and I am going to have to climb
  up on the roof and pick them off, one by one, with my deadly anti-hornet pellet
  rifle.
