full_text: 'PRACTICAL SEAGULL EXERCISES

  If you have a pet seagull, it is extremely important to ensure that it gets the
  requisite amount of exercise. Have you got any idea how dangerous it is for a seagull
  to become idle and listless? Many seabird doctors have, over the years, been driven
  to despair by the negligence of certain people who keep seagulls as pets. One such
  medic, whose name, by weird coincidence, is a perfect anagram of auk tern guillemot
  gull, has written a memoir in which he lambasts some of the feckless seaside-resort
  inhabitants whose gulls he came to tend. His language is at times violent, but what
  shines through the prose is a great love for seabirds and an almost pathological
  loathing of human beings.

  In an appendix, the doctor recommends certain exercises which the responsible gull-keeper
  ought to encourage a bird to perform as part of its fitness regime. Mindful of the
  depressed economies of most coastal regions, all of the exercises are designed to
  cost little in the way of kit. For example, gull exercise number ten, reprinted
  below, involves nothing more than access to a limitless supply of corrugated cardboard:

  Gull Exercise Number Ten

  Fetch a few large sheets of corrugated cardboard and take them to your seagull.
  Announce in a loud voice that you will reward the bird with a bucket of fish-heads
  and entrails if it tears the corrugated cardboard to pieces with its fearsome beak.
  Stand well back. Most well-balanced seagulls will shred the corrugated cardboard
  in a matter of minutes. Note: if you do not actually have a bucket full of fish-heads
  and entrails with which to reward the gull at the end of its exercise, it may become
  angered and vengeful, so make sure you are wearing protective clothing and have
  removed all traces of fish-odour from yourself by bathing in lemon juice, or alternatively
  keeping as far away from the harbour as you can, especially at those times when
  the fishing boats come in to port with their catch of sprats and gudgeon.


  THE BESMIRCHED AND BONKERS TOPIARY MAN : HIS HOODOO AND COLLAPSE

  I will tell you how it happened, in November 1919, in Holland.

  His besmirchment. His besmirchment was physical rather than moral, but no less catastrophic
  for that. He was walking beside a pond, and an evil-eyed tiny one careered towards
  him on a tricycle. In stepping aside to avoid a collision, he lost his footing and
  fell into the pond, and the pond was stagnant and brackish and rife with all that
  slimy green wispy stuff found in stagnant brackish ponds, so when he clambered out
  on to the path, sopping wet and lugubrious, his clothing was besmirched. He was
  poor, and had but that one suit of clothes, and so he remained besmirched.

  His being bonkers. His parents ran a private asylum, and he grew up in its grounds.
  His earliest pals were the madcaps, loons and holy innocents who were incarcerated
  there. Never diagnosed as lunatic himself, he nonetheless exhibited eccentricities
  and harboured strange casts of thought which led the wider world to view him as
  a zany, even forty years after his parents perished in the flames which laid waste
  their asylum.

  His topiary. How I wish I could write: "he was the finest topiarist the Netherlands
  ever produced", but I cannot, for he was not. In truth, his topiary was inept. More
  often than not, those few who came to view his work were unable to identify what
  he had meant to depict. By rifling through newspaper accounts, we know, for example,
  that when he unveiled his gigantic Belgian hedge entitled Judith Slaying Holofernes,
  the citizens of Antwerp thought they were looking at a representation of a giant
  pig. Similarly, the Foliage Portrait of Pope Pius IX was mistaken for a fruitbat.

  The hoodoo. This besmirched and bonkers man had the signal misfortune to be placed
  under a hoodoo by forces both malevolent and uncanny. All attempts to extricate
  himself from the hoodoo only made it more malign. The actual details are too sickening
  to recount. But let it be said that, at the last, angels played their pipes and
  bright wings bore his soul to heaven.

  His collapse. It was Thursday. He sat under the shade of a big tree with many branches
  and countless leaves. He was chewing a brazil nut and reading a paperback copy of
  A Dictionary of Glues. A chaffinch sang and the sky was blue. His matted hair had
  been cut the day before, and his boots were freshly repaired. The raucous hobbledehoys
  whose tauntings ruined his morning had gone off to cause mayhem on the railway tracks.
  He had been able to afford a pair of swimming trunks, and planned a dip in a nearby
  canal. He swallowed what was left of the nut, put the book in his satchel, stood
  up, and began to walk towards the Iron Palace. Halfway across the shimmering lawn,
  he collapsed. It was the very end of him.


  BLOTZMANN''S SYNDROME

  Recently we referred to an outbreak of cases of Blotzmann''s Syndrome, and certain
  medically-minded readers have written in to seek further information about this
  modern scourge. (It is a modern scourge, as opposed to a perennial scourge, because
  the first recorded case is from a few months ago, according to the medical journals
  to which I subscribe, albeit that in a paper presented to the first conference devoted
  to Blotzmann''s Syndrome--in Helsinki, in September--one Doctor Javier Illegible
  of Samarkand referred to a pandemic in the Land of Geese during the fifteenth century
  which may well have been an earlier instance of the condition, although we cannot
  be sure, and Doctor Illegible''s documentation has been questioned by both eminent
  physicians and by a few cantankerous autodidacts, chief among the latter the infamous
  nincompoop Father Ignacio Tweakling, priest, potter, topiarist and champion of Fletcherism,
  the once-popular dietary technique involving much chewing, "much chewing" not to
  be confused with the village of that name where Father Tweakling, by uncanny coincidence,
  lived, and this parenthetical sentence has gone on for far too long, so it must
  end now, or soon, though the sooner the better for all our sakes. There.)

  Blotzmann''s Syndrome is named after the man who first isolated it in laboratory
  conditions, whose name was Blotzmann. He had never met Father Tweakling, although
  he had encountered the priest''s sister on some kind of management training paintball
  exercise in woodland, to which he went on sufferance, after threats from his superior,
  a man whose psychometric tests showed him to be--and I quote from the hitherto confidential
  report--"flabby, petulant, and fixated upon cashew nuts".

  Blotzmann pelted Father Tweakling''s sister with twigs and berries, for he refused
  to carry a paintball gun. At sunset, he sat down and swept his hands across the
  forest floor.

  The generic term for all that stuff found on the ground in forests and woodland
  is "duff".

  Something Blotzmann''s fingers brushed lightly against gave him a piercing insight
  into the syndrome which now bears his name. He dashed back to the lab, did a few
  experiments with a bunsen burner and some substances mentioned in the Old Testament,
  and wrote up his findings in a frenzy, pressing the blotting paper to his scrawl
  as dawn broke. Lighting a cheroot, he stepped outside, and encountered a dairy person
  on her way to milk cows.

  "I have just isolated the agency whereby folk fall victim to a malady the nature
  of which has been befogged and blurry e''en to the best minds in the field of medicine,"
  said Blotzmann to the rosy-cheeked maiden, at five o clock in the morning. Unfortunately,
  her brain was so thoroughly consumed by an as-yet-unsolved cryptic crossword clue
  that she ignored him, and thus a love that could have conquered everything, a love
  of intense passion that would have been writ down the ages like that of Abelard
  and Heloise or of Tristan and Iseult was doomed never to spark.

  Blotzmann named his syndrome. The dairymaid milked her cows. But the two were destined
  never to meet again, on this planet or in any other existence that might await them,
  two lonely stars in a boundless and incomprehensible firmament.


  DOBSON IN RESIDENCE

  One of the more arresting facts about Dobson is that he spent a five-year period
  living in an evaporated milk factory in Winnipeg. Such was the hold on him of this
  location that he devoted no less than sixteen pamphlets to it. According to the
  statistician Aloysius Nestingbird, Dobson wrote more words about this factory than
  on any other topic. What was it about the place that exerted such a fascination
  upon Dobson? How significant is it that, during his stay there, the factory was
  still functioning, producing thousands of tins of evaporated milk every week, and
  not, as it is today, an abandoned ruin populated only by screeching birds? Was the
  workforce aware that the pamphleteer had taken up residence in an unused room on
  the mezzanine floor, and that he had attached his own design of bolts and latches
  to the door to prevent his being disturbed? Or that the carefully-lettered sign
  on the door, reading "S Q Perkins, Janitorial Padre", was a fake of Dobson''s devising?
  Was Dobson responsible for the occasional small theft of a few tins of evaporated
  milk noted in a big ledger by the management''s security team? Was it really necessary
  for the security team to march about the premises in gangs of four, dressed in uniforms
  not unlike those of a fascist junta, accompanied by howling, slavering dogs, each
  as tall as a ten-year-old? Were the dogs skittish when taken to their kennels at
  the end of a security tour? Did a wet-behind-the-ears junior evaporated milk technical
  consultant take the rap for the missing tins? Was he dismissed and did he have his
  epaulettes thrown into the shredder? What in the name of heaven was Dobson doing
  in that room for five years? Why are the answers to these cogent questions entirely
  absent from Dobson''s pamphlets? And, most importantly, what birds screech there
  now?


  FIRE!

  In May 1855, The Eclectic Magazine (London, I think) published the following:

  The origin of fires is now so narrowly inquired into by the officers of the Brigade,
  by means of inquests, that we have been made acquainted with a vast number of curious
  causes, which would never have been suspected. From an analysis of fires which have
  occurred since the establishment of the Brigade, we have constructed the following
  [list]:

  Curtains 2,511--Candle 1,178--Flues 1,555--Stoves 494--Gas 932--Light dropped down
  Area 13--Lighted Tobacco falling down ditto 7--Dust falling on horizontal Flue 1--Doubtful

  58--Fire from Iron Kettle 1--Sealing Letter 1--Charcoal Fire of a Suicide 1--Insanity

  NB : Glyn Webster writes (17th January) to comment "It''s a good thing we don''t
  need those hazardous dittos any more. I would write more, but my monkey has been
  upset by a clotheshorse."


  ON THE BONNY BONNY BANKS

  On the bonny bonny banks of the foul old loch, where a dredger plied from shore
  to shore, I saw my true love pluck some furze and place it in her hair. My true
  love was a wandering lass of a clan that herded cows, and she broke her back when
  she had a mishap with a trampoline. For her folk herded cows through the seasons
  long, but they also jumped and leaped. They would wander into the market square
  of a town down in some dale, and they''d bounce up and down and gambol about wearing
  coats of many hues. And the songs they sang! Oh, the songs they sang were as strange
  as strange could be. I remember one that went "Vienna--it means nothing to me".
  All caked and painted were their carts, yellow, green and blue. But my true love''s
  cart was black as pitch, as black as the raven and crow. I stand in the hills in
  an icy gale wondering where will my true love go? Green grow the rushes-oh, on those
  bonny bonny banks.


  JOHNFOWLESOPOLY

  David Stoop has sent in a story from a game of Johnfowlesopoly (see "A Word Game",
  23rd March).

  Once upon a time, there was a debauched fairy named Bindweed. Bindweed, who liked
  to dress in fashionable, foreign-made fairy clothes, had a fairy sister called Ringrot.
  Ringrot was jaded and neurotic. On the day the big spaceship landed in Dandelion
  Dell, with its whirling propellors, Bindweed and Ringrot went skipping along to
  greet the goo-splattered alien beings.

  "Ugh!" screeched Bindweed, "Aren''t they sickening?"

  Ringrot began to vomit, right next to the spaceship. The goo-splattered alien beings
  were extremely disturbed by this bestial behaviour. They climbed back into their
  spaceship and flew off to another planet, called Zixurg-K79. Goodnight children.

  Our critic writes: David has made a pretty good fist of it, I think. All nine adjectives
  are included, the story is very short, and I would certainly read it to my grandchildren
  at bedtime.


  "[IT WAS] MERRO DAAK, THE FASHIONABLE RADIO..."

  "[It was] Merro Daak, the fashionable radio astrologer, whose name was on every
  woman''s tongue. Slade had seen him often, passing through the village in his big
  foreign-made car, with his jaded and debauched companions, on whose neurotic faces
  Slade''s eye had read the imprint of sickening abnormalities. Did the orgies which
  were said to go on in Merro Daak''s house have any bearing on these bestial atrocities?
  Slade plodded back to his car. His brain was a whirling chaos." -- John H. Knox,
  The Thing That Dined On Death'
