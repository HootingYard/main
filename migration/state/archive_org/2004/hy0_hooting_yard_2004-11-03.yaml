full_text: 'TEX-MEX JIFFY BAG SPRITES

  Did you know that in the world of faeries there is a specific type of sprite which
  dwells within jiffy bags of Tex-Mex origin? These mischievous sprites are reluctant
  to leave the snug lining of their bags, except to flit from one to another when
  they become oh so lonesome and feel compelled to procreate. If you creep ever so
  silently into a postal sorting office in El Paso at dead of night, you might be
  lucky enough to see a flickering sprite leaping between jiffy bags. If it sees you,
  it will be vexed, and cast a spell on you, and for twenty-six days and nights you
  will be tormented by visions of potato-headed monsters spewing ectoplasm in every
  direction. But if the sprite does not see you, you will have good luck for a twelvemonth,
  possibly involving the unexpected offer of an appearance in a radio advertisement
  for a thrilling new detergent or bleach product. That, at any rate, is what I was
  told by the Weird Woman of Woohooweedywood, and she has yet to be proved wrong in
  any of her pronouncements or incantations, except for the one about the badger in
  the hedge.


  These are not Tex-Mex Jiffy Bag Sprites. They are Cottingley Fairies.


  WRITER''S BLOCK

  Even Dobson, the indefatigable pamphleteer, occasionally suffered from writer''s
  block. Whenever he was assailed by this pernicious malady, he took the advice of
  the country-and-western singer Tad Chew (distantly related to his amanuensis and
  printer, Marigold). Chew once wrote a song about the moon, and Dobson would dig
  out the old 78 and give it a few spins on the phonograph. He would then sit down
  at his escritoire and force himself to scribble sentences of a lunar kidney, caring
  not a jot whether or not they made any sense. So, for example, he would write:

  There are a few phosphorescent fancies about the moon, like ignes fatui, which we
  may dispose of. Those of them that are mythical are too evanescent to become full-grown
  myths; and those which are religious are too volatile to remain in the solution
  or salt of any bottled creed. Like the wandering lights of the Russians, answering
  to our will-o''-the-wisp, they are the souls of still-born children.

  Or, gulping lukewarm tap water as he worked, he may scrawl something like:

  Ecclesiastical history will declare how, as early as the close of the fourth century,
  the women who were called Collyridians worshipped the Virgin Mary as a moon goddess,
  and judged it necessary to appease her anger, and seek her favour and protection,
  by libations, sacrifices, and oblations of cakes (collyridae). This is but a repetition
  of the women kneading dough to make cakes to the Queen of Heaven, as recorded by
  Jeremiah; and proves that the relative position occupied by Astarte in company with
  Baal, Juno with Jupiter, Doorga with Brahma, and Ma-tsoo-po with Boodh, is that
  occupied by Mary with God.

  If he was feeling particularly fraught, Dobson would even scribble this:

  A fine circumstance occurred in the shipwreck of the Santiago, 1585. The ship struck
  in the night; the wretched crew had been confessing, singing litanies, etc., and
  this they continued till, about two hours before break of day, the moon arose beautiful
  and exceeding bright; and forasmuch as till that time they had been in such darkness
  that they could scarcely see one another when close at hand, such was the stir among
  them at beholding the brightness and glory of that orb, that most part of the crew
  began to lift up their voices, and with tears, cries, and groans called upon Our
  Lady, saying they saw her in the moon.

  Page after page of such verbal pap spewed from Dobson''s pencil, until he was overcome
  by cramps, at which point he would take the accumulated papers out to a field and
  cast them unto the winds, in the night, under the gleam of that mighty silver orb.


  THE FIELD OF THE CLOTH OF GOLD

  Yes, that''s what I said, the field of the cloth of gold. That is where I have just
  been, and it is where I want you to go. So up you get from your bed of straw, pin
  those crutches under your armpits, and get cracking. I have made you a packed lunch
  of beetroot pie, potato thirds and juice squeezed from nettles, so you will not
  go hungry on your journey. Wait. I want you to take this owl with you. There are
  far too many fieldmice scurrying around in the field of the cloth of gold, and the
  owl will tear them to shreds with its lacerating beak. The lucky ones will escape
  by running off to the adjoining field, if luck is something one can ascribe to mice.
  What do you think? Does Dame Fortune shine her bright lantern on such tiny beasts,
  or is she only concerned with that which is human? Speaking of which, you had better
  have a wash and spruce yourself up before you go. You look as if you haven''t been
  out of that bed of straw for months. Just because all the bones in both your legs
  are fractured beyond repair is no excuse. Why do you think I shelled out ten fat
  coins to buy you the crutches? Why do you think I got Old Hengist to varnish them
  so splendidly? Take the owl to the field of the cloth of gold and come straight
  back. I have another job for you. The spigot is jammed, and not for nothing are
  you known as The Man Who Can Unjam Spigots With His Eyes Shut. Get thee hence!


  GIGANTIC BOLIVIAN ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAMS--I

  I am minded to post an old, old story from the last century. Gigantic Bolivian Architectural
  Diagrams is divided into three parts. The first part follows. Parts two and three
  will appear over the coming weekend.

  I. September 1894

  I had been marooned on the island for eleven weeks when I discovered the gigantic
  Bolivian architectural diagrams, rolled into a metal canister and wedged in a narrow
  crevice between two rocks. Taking a swig from my bag of turtle''s blood, I squatted
  on the ground and removed the diagrams from the canister. There were about a dozen
  large sheets, rather frayed around the edges but perfectly legible. The top left
  corner of each sheet had been stamped with an official device of the Bolivian administration,
  showing an escutcheon, a ziggurat, the helmet of a conquistador, the hand of God,
  and abbreviations in neat italic lettering. The signature of what I supposed to
  be a petty official had been scratched across each of the stamps in mauve ink.

  Munching a whelk, I turned my attentions to the diagrams themselves. They were fearfully
  complicated. I am no architect, and at first all I could make out were miriad lines
  meeting at angles and criss-crossing each other seemingly at random. Most of the
  diagrams had been subjected to revision, and there was much evidence of erasure,
  overprinting and churlish emendation. My studies were interrupted by a sudden and
  ferocious thunderstorm. Shoving the diagrams hastily back into the canister, unfortunately
  tearing one of them, I hobbled back to my shelter, where my viper was busy biting
  the head off an unidentified rodent. Tossing my crutches into the corner, I lay
  back on my pallet and spent a profitable hour mucking about with bits of wire and
  driftwood to make a trap for bats.

  The life of a maroon, on an island such as this, is not unpleasing. Food is plentiful
  and easily gathered, or slaughtered. The vegetation is lush and the animals are
  slow-witted and trusting. On my very first day I was able to bash out the brains
  of a badger which trundled innocently towards me as I sat on the beach idling with
  my club. Quite what a badger was doing on the island is beyond me. I have not come
  across any others. But I am ever vigilant. I will not risk boring you by listing
  the stupendous array of equipment I managed to salvage from the wreck of the HMS
  Tot of Magnesium. Suffice to say the club was not my only weapon; nor am I at a
  loss for a change of trousers.

  I have told you that I am not an architect. The truth is, I cannot remember what
  I am, what trade or business I followed on dry land. Perhaps I was a jolly jack
  tar; but I think it unlikely. I like to think that I was aboard the Tot of Magnesium
  as a supernumerary passenger, a merchant of sorts, my cabin crammed with samples
  of tea, or silk, or mustard. In the final desperate moments, as the ship pitched
  and rolled and smashed against gleaming rocks, I received a blow to the head which
  has impaired my memory. It was not the only injury I received. My right leg is only
  just recovering. I was thankful that among the first items from the ship washed
  up on the beach was a wooden box of sinapisms from the surgeon''s casket. In the
  first days of my marooning, the lifeless bodies of my shipmates were washed up on
  shore, white, puffed, gruesome. I ticked off the dead in an impromptu ledger, which
  I have since mislaid. The bodies did not lie there long. Enormous birds swooped
  out of the sky, hooked the dead in their vicious beaks, and bore them off. Their
  nests are not on this island; I have searched every inch of it. The gigantic Bolivian
  architectural diagrams came to light on one of my earliest searches. For the first
  few weeks I was so sure of being rescued by a passing smack or schooner that I could
  barely bring myself to move. I sprawled on the beach, knocking out the brains of
  a variety of curious animals, applying sinapisms to my wounds and gashes, and covering
  myself with an old bit of sailcloth at night, or during rainfall. At last a ship
  hove into view. I hopped about like a mad thing, shouting and raving in Latin, following
  the advice of my Jesuit mentors. Eventually I realised that the craft I was hailing
  was none other than what was left of the Tot of Magnesium, seen from an advantageous
  angle. If, dear reader, you were expert in tides and currents, in the pleasingly
  complex science of the movement of seas, I would ask you how it was that this broken
  wreck of a ship sailed about for nine or ten weeks without sinking, only to return
  to the spot where razor-sharp rocks hidden beneath the waves had pierced its fabric
  and brought about its doom. But I suspect you are not.

  It was at this stage that I conquered my indolence and set to work. In forty-eight
  hours, I salvaged everything I could carry from the ship, constructed a raft, knocked
  up a shelter from planks and sail-cloth, knocked up another shelter when the first
  one collapsed on top of me, this time shoring up the sides with some sort of metal,
  killed eight turtles, made a store for buckets, dug some holes, lost my death-ledger,
  ate a pickled wren I found in the surgeon''s casket, and hardly paused for sleep.
  The next day I began my search of the island. I found a mulberry bush and some gemstones.
  On the second day I found bauxite deposits, a waterfall, big grains of sand and
  what looked like the bones of a horse. On the third day I found the gigantic Bolivian
  architectural diagrams. On the fourth day I found a crushed encampment of beetles,
  and a cave full of the most loathsome bats I had ever seen. So it went on, day after
  day. In two weeks I had covered the island. All the while I had been making careful
  notes, and now I rested and spent my days drawing an exquisitely detailed map. I
  tacked this up above my pallet. As night fell, and my blubber candles spluttered,
  I lay back and considered my island home. With nary a smack or schooner in sight,
  I could remain marooned for years on end. My shelter may not last, buffeted as it
  was by howling winds and freezing rain. I decided that the best place for me to
  live would be the cave. I declared war on the bats.


  DEWORMING YOUR GOAT THE HOOTING YARD WAY

  Is there anything more important in the early days of November than deworming your
  goat? If you are a pig-fixated person you may wish to differ, but most if not all
  Hooting Yard readers will want to ensure that their goats are innocent of worms
  in this critical month in the Capra hircus life-cycle. Here then, are some useful
  tips. Read them carefully, making notes on a scrap of paper as appropriate, for
  you will want to refer to the tips once you have ranged across the fields in your
  big leaking boots to the goat cubicles.


  A goat (named Simon Peter) standing in front of another goat (called Pius IX)

  If possible, always weigh your goat before deworming it. Use any old scales you
  can lay your hands on, but preferably ones in which a goat will squat happily for
  a minute or two. When you have weighed your goat, you will be able to calculate
  and inject or drench the correct dosage of the dewormer. If you underdose your goat
  because of failure to weigh it, or because you fecklessly underestimate just how
  bulky or indeed unbulky it is, this may be a costly mistake. It may lead to your
  goat developing that most fearsome of conditions, viz. parasite resistance to dewormers!
  But don''t rest on your laurels like a smug goat-person, because an overdose of
  certain proprietary dewormers can cause health problems, if not for your goat then
  for you and your immediate family and the neighbours up in the big black house on
  the hill. All sorts of hideous running sores, boils and suppurations can occur if
  you overdose your goat, although I am not quite sure how that happens, in a strictly
  scientific sense. Nevertheless, you do not want to upset those eerie lantern-jawed
  neighbours of yours after what happened in March, up in the hills, during a thunderstorm,
  with all that eldritch inhuman howling, do you?


  CUPPID

  Cuppid is, as you might expect, related to Cupid, although there is a lot more than
  that extra P to help you distinguish between them. Cuppid is composed of both toxic
  and non-toxic gases, and tinkles a little golden bell whenever it alights upon the
  hairy back of a bison, which it often does, for Cuppid''s favourite haunts are the
  vast plains of North America. I say it because Cuppid is, if not exactly a hermaphrodite,
  neither male nor female, although sometimes when its gases cool and take on liquid
  form it can bear a fugitive resemblance to Sonja Henie (1912-1969), the legendary
  Norwegian figure skating champion. Such moments can be dangerous for Cuppid, for
  it is volatile, and seeks warmer air urgently to return to its gaseous state.

  Cuppid is invoked by farmers and by those who work with timber, for it brings them
  luck. Conversely, wrestlers and plutocrats live in fear of a visitation by Cuppid,
  and tremble at its approach. You can be sure that if you see a trembling plutocrat,
  Cuppid is not far away.

  Some say Cuppid can be trapped in an envelope or small carton and used for both
  good and ill. The common feature of such tales is that not one of them has ever
  been verified.

  Toy plastic Cuppids, coated with a special varnish to ape the appearance of gas,
  have recently become popular as gifts for children in Dawlish, Oswestry and Uttoxeter.
  This geographical exclusivity is due to factors unique to Cuppid, including the
  risk of suffocation, impending thirst, and three or four empty metal pails lined
  up in a row on the site of a long ago mudslide.

  Cuppid rotates.
