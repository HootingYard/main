full_text: 'THE SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON

  Have you ever met someone from Switzerland named Robinson? Someone named Robinson,
  from Switzerland, who has been shipwrecked? I have. I was sitting in a coffee bar
  in Old Grimy Town up north, and as I sipped my cocoa and leafed through yesterday''s
  copy of The Old Grimy Town Gazette, in walked Fathead Robinson and Poopy Robinson
  and their children Ned, Gristle and Sawdust. They sat at my table.

  "We are the Swiss Family Robinson," said Fathead. "We are from Switzerland, and
  we were shipwrecked."

  I looked at them one by one, trying to see evidence of their ordeal.

  "When was this?" I asked.

  "Years ago," said Poopy, "We were rescued by a big boat of birds."

  "A boat of birds?" I asked.

  "Yes," said Ned, "It was a big boat and there were no humans aboard it, only birds.
  Starlings and chaffinches and buntings and wagtails and corncrakes and linnets and
  sparrows and swans."

  "Was a swan the captain?" I asked.

  "Yes," said Ned, "How did you guess?"

  I fixed him with my one working eye, sipped the dregs of my cocoa, and stood up.
  Saying nothing, I swept out of the coffee bar, and went straight home to write in
  my diary. Today I met the Swiss Family Robinson, I wrote, and then I put down my
  pencil and became lachrymose, thinking about swans imperilled on the high seas,
  and my parrot, Lascelles, who yearned for Colombia, where he was born, on a bright
  summer day so many years ago.


  TWO IMPORTANT BIRTHDAYS

  In spite of that little grumble in today''s first item, never let Hooting Yard be
  accused of being out of touch with popular culture. It''s just that we''re discriminating
  in what we pay attention to. Today, for example, we celebrate the double birthday
  of not just one of the finest male voice icons in twentieth century cinema, but
  two.

  Christopher Plummer is 77 today, and decades have passed since his bizarre, strangulated,
  bird-like squawkings as Atahualpa in The Royal Hunt Of The Sun. I have spent hours
  upon hours trawling the internet to find out if a Plummermaniac has posted sound
  samples from the film, but to no avail. Happy birthday, Atahualpa.

  Born on the same day two years before Plummer was Dick Van Dyke, the man who invented
  cockney, or possibly mockney, or whatever that accent was that he used to such powerful
  effect in Mary Poppins. Chim chim cheroo indeed. One little-known fact about Dick,
  possibly because it is entirely spurious, is that he signed a multibillion dollar
  deal to allow his initials to be used by the manufacturers of DVD technology. At
  one point, the now-ubiquitous discs were going to be called EVDs, because Chariots
  Of The Gods? author and wag Erich Von Daniken was asking for less money for his
  initials. The full story is told in Chimney Sweep Versus Spaceman : A Gripping Thriller
  Of The Business World, available from all good airports.


  ONE MORNING ON THE LANE THAT RUNS FROM POINTY TOWN TO COCTLOSH

  It was a sweltering day. I was strolling along the lane that runs from Pointy Town
  to Coctlosh when I chanced upon a Jesuit priest sitting on a bench. I tipped my
  hat and greeted him.

  "Hello," I said, "What a sweltering day it is."

  "Felix Randal the farrier o is he dead then?" said the priest, and I realised that
  I was talking to Gerard Manley Hopkins.

  "Father Hopkins!" I cried, perhaps a tad overenthusiastically, for he frowned at
  me and said: "My duty all ended, who have watched his mould of man, big-boned and
  hardy-handsome, pining--"

  "Would you like a bite of my medlar?" I interrupted, and as I did so a dapple-dawn-drawn
  falcon flew past, narrowly missing my head.

  "Pining," continued Hopkins, without taking a blind bit of notice of my fruit-sharing
  initiative, "till time when reason rambled in it and some fatal four disorders,
  fleshed there, all contended?"

  Swallowing a chunk of medlar, I wondered about these four disorders.

  "Impetigo, ague, the bloody flux and Blotzmann''s syndrome?" I asked.

  Father Hopkins was now fretting with his rosary beads.

  "Sickness broke him," he said. I was beginning to wonder why the priest was chuntering
  on about a dead farrier, but I decided to sit down on the bench. He didn''t flinch.
  He kept talking, but I was no longer listening. I had become transfixed by the sight
  of a flock of weird unholy birds circling above us. They were black and purple and
  huge, with savage talons and a wingspan of monstrous proportions. Could they be
  the legendary Birds of Bog I had read about in my little primer when I was an infant
  at Sunday School?

  Suddenly Father Hopkins tapped me on the shoulder.

  "How far from then forethought of," he was shouting, "all thy more boisterous years,
  when thou at the random grim forge, powerful amidst peers, didst fettle for the
  great grey drayhorse his bright and battering sandal!"

  The last few words were yelled so loudly that my hat nearly fell off my head. But
  it seemed as if the priest had finished jabbering at last. I felt a sudden urge
  to kiss his hand, as if he were a bishop, but I decided not to. Instead, I thrust
  my last medlar at him.

  "Take it, take it, Father Hopkins," I said, and I got up and walked away. All in
  all, it was quite an interesting morning.


  Father Hopkins, S.J.


  OLD DODDERY MARTIN

  Old doddery Martin trudged through the park. His hat was askew of course. He blanched
  when he saw the vinegar man who came all the way from the outskirts of Minsk. Why
  was a Minsk-man here in the park? A man who was jabbering at a crow in a tree? Doddery
  Martin mussed his hair. He went to feed the park''s polar bear. He fed it with biscuits
  and nuts. I said, he fed it with biscuits and nuts. Back in Vietnam, old doddery
  Martin had gutted huts. He''d been a keen marine in his time. Now he forged banknotes
  in a basement by the Seine, in Paris, in Paris, in the capital of France, where
  his banknotes were passed from hand to hand by evil men, banknotes made by doddery
  Martin, home at last from Vietnam.


  TINY ENID CONFRONTS THE RUSSIAN BEAR

  Tiny Enid put down her book and sighed. She was reading, I think, one of the later
  novels of Daphne Du Maurier, and it was beginning to irritate her. She decided to
  go and check on the gloxinia in her garden. Stepping out through the french windows,
  she saw that the great Russian bear was prowling around at the bottom of her garden.
  When it saw Tiny Enid, it let out a fierce bellow.

  Tiny Enid sat down in her ugly but highly-polished stainless steel garden chair,
  the one she had rescued from a burning building all those years ago. She lit a cheroot,
  inhaled deeply, and fixed the Russian bear with a supercilious, sneering look. She
  wondered if this was the same Russian bear that had mauled to death Vitaly Nikolayenko,
  one of Russia''s best-known bear researchers and a man who spent twenty-five years
  living with the enormous brown bears of the wild Kamchatka peninsula. He had been
  found dead in an apparent bear mauling. The body of Nikolayenko, sixty-six, whose
  lonely journeys allowed him to compile one of the most exhaustive documentaries
  on the giant, nine-foot cousins of the North American grizzly, was found at a lake
  near his remote one-room hut on the Tikhaya River. The six-and-a-half-inch pawprint
  of a medium-sized male bear was found next to his body, along with an empty can
  of pepper spray with which Nikolayenko had apparently tried to defend himself.

  Just two months before, American bear researcher Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend
  were killed by a bear in Alaska''s Katmai National Park.

  The diminutive Nikolayenko, a self-educated researcher and photographer, walked
  more than six hundred and twenty miles a year through the remote river valleys and
  coastal plains of Kamchatka, whose giant brown bears were under increasing threat
  from foreign hunters and poachers. A senior ranger on the Kronotsky Wildlife Reserve,
  Nikolayenko battled illegal hunting and fishing in the reserve. His patrols kept
  him in the wilderness for months on end. He spent each day from dawn to dusk following
  bears, documenting their feeding, mating, and social habits. By night, he would
  return to his hut, light a kerosene lamp and fill what became hundreds of journals,
  a body of work that eventually became one of the most important biographical records
  of brown bear behaviour in existence. He documented an average of eight hundred
  bear contacts each year, according to Los Angeles Times reporter Kim Murphy.

  "Did you maul Vitaly Nikolayenko to death?" asked Tiny Enid. The Russian bear was
  now lumbering across the lawn towards her, but when it heard her high-pitched voice,
  redolent of a terrified crow, it stopped and thwacked its mighty paws against its
  own head. It is not easy for a Russian bear to look shamefaced and coy, but the
  one in Tiny Enid''s garden did so.

  "Now get along with you," she said, stubbing out her cheroot under her jet black
  Manolo Blahnik pump, "Go and do something useful like grubbing for worms in the
  muck by yonder pond."

  The Russian bear turned and fled. Tiny Enid got up and crossed the lawn to shut
  the garden gate. Then she went to the airport to catch her flight to Madagascar,
  or possibly to Plovdiv, I am not quite sure where she went that day.


  STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN

  Researchers claim to have found a picture of one of Dobson''s out-of-print pamphlets.
  One of the researchers is tall and Hungarian. The other is lantern-jawed and recently
  suffered from gastroenteritis. They have only been working together for a short
  time, and have never met face-to-face, communicating via a virtually redundant communications
  system involving pneumatics, magnets and steam.


  I have to say that this picture looks more like a book than a pamphlet, in which
  case it may be the unimaginably rare Stairway To Heaven, one of Dobson''s most puzzling
  works. The picture is too small to decipher the text, so we can only suppose.

  Stairway To Heaven was written in the first flush of Dobson''s youth, the manuscript
  scribbled in a clutch of exercise books the pamphleteer-to-be stole from an enormous
  locomotive stuck in a railway siding. The guards had apparently gone off to paddle
  in a pond and hunt wild boar while they waited for spare parts.

  The book is subtitled Some Conjectures On The Possible Location Of An Actual Staircase
  That Leads To The Celestial Sphere, and is a remarkably assured text for one so
  young. It begins thus:

  As I wander through the wilderness of this world, I often fall to wondering how
  I will get to heaven. I know it is there somewhere, for that is what my mama and
  papa have told me ever since I was a tot. I know, too, that every single thing they
  have ever told me is true, because they vowed it was so. They made these vows to
  me on my sixth birthday, as papa cut my cake and shortly after mama clambered in
  through the window after chasing away a robber with her high velocity sniper''s
  rifle. She came through the window of the kitchen because at that time the door
  to the cottage was sealed shut against fiends and demons, known to prey upon good
  folk in the countryside where I grew. Papa used quick-drying cement for the job,
  completing the work in just an hour on the one day that winter when there was no
  rain or snow, for we lived in a valley. If there is ever a second edition of this
  book I will check a meteorological reference work to check the accuracy of that
  statement.

  There never was a second edition, of course, a fact that sometimes finds me lying
  awake all night, sobbing into my blankets, big blankets from Finland, where it is
  important to keep warm and snug through the long, long winter night.


  TENTH ANNIVERSARY (II)

  We are celebrating ten years of the Hooting Yard website between now and Christmas
  by reposting an item from each calendar year. This piece, entitled Three Blue Days
  Of Imbecilic Glee, appeared on Monday 13 December 2004.

  The first blue day of imbecilic glee was a Tuesday towards the end of March. In
  truth, the day was not blue, for there was frightful storminess, a blizzard of hailstones,
  and much tempest and wrack. Nevertheless, when looking back, I remember other things.
  I remember how we laughed even though our picnic plans were dashed. I remember how
  we pretended the cow in the field was a Magus, bewitching us. I remember how we
  ran back to the house and spent the afternoon playing a game of Ayn Rand! Every
  time you shouted a sentence from The Fountainhead and I countered with one from
  Atlas Shrugged, the uproar was such that Mr Loog Oldham next door took off his big
  black boot and hammered on the wall. I remember the embers at the end of that first
  blue day.

  The second blue day of imbecilic glee was that day we took our bicycles on the train
  to the fishing village at the end of the world and painted watercolours of the post
  office and bought stamps and drank Tizer and we were followed around the village
  by a one-eyed dog with terrible fangs and you wanted to take it home and all afternoon
  the shrill singing of the orphanage choir filled our ears and I found a tiny toy
  plastic pig in a thicket of stinging nettles and we cycled all the way home along
  that dangerous road as huge container lorries thundered past us in both directions.

  The third blue day of imbecilic glee is today.


  THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL

  Today is not only the Hooting Yard website''s first birthday, it is also the feast
  day of St John of the Cross, author of that classic work The Dark Night Of The Soul.
  I recommend a thorough reading of the text, if only to remind oneself that this
  is the original, and is not to be confused with Park No Lip''s Korean underworld
  pulp potboiler The Dark Night Of Seoul, which is in itself a classic, but in a different
  way.


  St John of the Cross

  Alas, in his dotage, Dobson did get the books mixed up, which is why his pamphlet
  A Full And Frank Commentary On "The Dark Night Of The Soul", Wherein Certain Controversial
  Theories Are Proposed Which Have Led The Author Into Fist-Fights With Sailors Outside
  Tough Drinking Taverns In The Marseilles Dockyards (out-of-print) is such a scrappy
  piece of work. Reading it, one can only rue the day that Dobson accepted medical
  advice from a charlatan, and began to take regular infusions of a so-called "patent
  embrocation for the cranium" which made his last days such a trial.

  Aloysius Nestingbird commented "If I ever get my hands on that quack I will strangle
  him with string and fling his lifeless corpse off the end of one of the jetties
  to which I have the right of access after a series of lengthy court cases which
  you don''t want to hear about, believe you me". Nestingbird said this to me--spitting
  vitriol--while we rummaged around in a battered old bureau somewhere deep in the
  Dobson Archives, trying to find evidence that the pamphleteer had ever actually
  visited the notorious French port. That he once spent an afternoon in Le Havre,
  accompanied by a chuckling maniac, we well knew. But Marseilles? Could it be that
  the title of Dobson''s late pamphlet was a piece of fantastic embroidery? If so,
  his entire career would take on a new complexion, and an unwelcome one.

  Before Nestingbird and myself were able to complete our search of the bureau, a
  hot and unexpected lamentable thing happened, and we had to abandon the building.
  As we blundered our way towards the perimeter fence, a messenger ran towards us
  bearing news of a new Yoko Ono installation. There was only one thing to do.

  Bafflingly, the bureau has since disappeared, and with it any chance of completing
  the magazine article Was Dobson In Marseilles?--A Discursive Analysis, for which
  Nestingbird and I had been promised a few pounds, or if not that much at least enough
  for a potato each. But penury, it seems, is destined to dog my footsteps.


  The Seamen''s Mission in the port of Marseilles : was Dobson ever here?


  CONSTANCE, BEREFT

  The pigs needed feeding, so Constance took a big crate full of apples and trudged
  out in the morning drizzle. The apples were pippins, and mostly rotten, but she
  knew that the pigs would guzzle them down. Over by the aircraft hangar a flop-eared
  bunny rabbit was hopping about among a pile of abandoned pots and pans. Constance
  worried about rust, but not today. She tipped the apples into the pigsty, put the
  empty crate onto a pile of other empty crates, and headed off towards the orchard
  as dawn was breaking. Constance had an assignation in the orchard.

  The following day, before her assignation, Constance not only fed the pigs with
  a crate full of overripe plums, but she gathered up all the pots and pans strewn
  around the door of the aircraft hangar and derusted them with a derusting solution
  of her own devising. The flop-eared bunny rabbit was nowhere to be seen, but she
  saw an Arctic hare on the horizon. Then she trotted off excitedly to the orchard.


  This is what an Arctic hare looks like

  On the Thursday, she was late getting to the orchard for her assignation, because
  one of the pigs had contracted a lethal pig disease, and she ran across the muddy
  fields to call the local veterinary surgeon, a mutton-chopped old fool with watery
  eyes. He was still abed, and Constance knocked and knocked on his door to rouse
  him. When he eventually came down in his dressing gown, not quite awake, and unlatched
  his door, the following dialogue took place:

  Constance : Vet, vet, I have a sick pig!

  Veterinary Surgeon : Let me get dressed and put all the necessaries in my bag and
  I will come with you.

  Constance : Hurry, hurry, vet! The pig may die!

  Veterinary Surgeon : I will do my utmost to save your pig.

  Because Constance had run across the fields to call the veterinary surgeon, she
  was late for her assignation in the orchard. When she got there, at last, she found
  a note fastened to a withered old pugton tree. She read only half of it before hot
  tears welled up and she fled from the orchard sobbing and bereft.

  Back at the pigsty, the watery-eyed veterinary surgeon was packing up his bag. Constance
  blundered through the gate, fraught and weeping and wild-eyed.

  Veterinary Surgeon : I have cured the pig, Miss Constance. All will be well.

  Constance, Bereft : The Motion Picture is currently in production, starring Cher
  as Constance and Kevin Costner as the veterinary surgeon.'
