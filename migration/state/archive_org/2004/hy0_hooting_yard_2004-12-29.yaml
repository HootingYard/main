full_text: 'ONLINE LEARNING WITH HOOTING YARD

  Here is the first tranche of a new series in which we will attempt to provide a
  thorough and valuable learning experience for all our readers. Perhaps you failed
  to pay attention when you were at your community hub? [Note: you may recall it being
  called a "school". That was then...] Online Learning With Hooting Yard can help
  you catch up with all the vital information that passed you by.

  Each lesson--specially devised by a team headed by Fatima Gilliblat--consists of
  two questions, to which model answers are given. They have been carefully researched
  and are guaranteed correct. No longer need you be stuck for an answer when accosted
  in the street, or buttonholed at a fashionable cocktail party in a rotating restaurant
  at the top of a high building. Memorise the answers, or, if your memory is a sorry
  and puny thing, write them down on the cuff of your shirt or blouse on the same
  side as you wear your wristwatch. You will soon be sparkling in company, and everyone
  will be envious of your cleverness.

  Lesson One

  Q--Are crocodiles frightened of otters?

  A--Yes they are. If crocodiles roam into a stretch of river where otters are prevalent,
  they will hasten away, for crocodiles fear otters.

  Q--How did a priest in Bolivia early in the last century supplement his income?

  A--He divided his graveyard into three sections--Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell--and
  charged for burials accordingly.


  ASK UNCLE DAN

  Dear Uncle Dan

  I have been given a burlap sack full of old crocuses and I have no idea what to
  do with it. Please help.

  Valentine Smew

  Uncle Dan says: Well, Valentine, whenever I read the word "crocuses" I think of
  ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging, also called kado, or "the way of
  the flowers". Get yourself a vase and transfer the crocuses from the sack. Throw
  the sack away. Now--be deft! Manipulate the crocuses with delicacy, taste and vision.
  There is, of course, the possibility that you lack these qualities, in which case
  you may be better occupied throwing the crocuses away and retaining the burlap sack.
  With a pair of scissors and a sewing machine you will soon be able to turn it into
  a mightily uncomfortable vest which can be wrapped up and given as a Christmas or
  birthday gift to a devout Roman Catholic. Jesuit priests in particular are known
  to be fond of such garb. If you do not number any Jesuits among your acquaintances,
  I would recommend visiting the SJ Web, an excellent resource "connecting Jesuits
  and friends around the world". The Lord be with you, Valentine Smew.


  WHAT DOBSON DID ON BOXING DAY

  [This piece first appeared in December 2004. How things change. Four years ago it
  appears that a contraption called the telephone was still in use at Hooting Yard,
  rather than the more familiar, and much groovier, metal tapping machine.]

  Throughout his life, Dobson ignored Christmas, but he loved to celebrate Boxing
  Day. Every year, he made a point of marking the occasion differently. Here is his
  journal entry for one year during the 1950s.

  Ah, Boxing Day at last! What a glorious day it is. This year there is snow on the
  ground, robin redbreasts hopping about, and Dickensian scenes of wassail and carousing
  over by the old thatched tavern. That being the case, I have nailed fast the shutters
  and am sitting in the gloom. I wired up a microphone next to the indoor wasps''
  nest, so hectic buzzing drowns out the intolerable sound of carol-singing and suchlike
  torments.

  I breakfasted upon a platter of boiled leeks and steamed viper-heads. I will spend
  much of the day in the kitchen, boiling more leeks and steaming more viper-heads
  for my supper. I had a new telephone installed last week, and I intend to take a
  break from boiling and steaming to call the police. I am going to read out my new
  pamphlet to the desk sergeant, or whoever answers the telephone, for it concerns
  police matters, specifically the legal position regarding the theft of leeks from
  the greengrocers'' and of vipers from the zoo. In the pamphlet, which I wrote in
  pig Latin, just to show off, I make a full confession to having used thievery to
  obtain my Boxing Day foodstuffs, and justify doing so with reference to certain
  historical and/or mythological figures, including Hildegard von Bingen, Sir Herbert
  Beerbohm Tree, and the Warrior King Anaxagrotax. I also make mention of the prince-electors
  of the Holy Roman Empire as a way of throwing the coppers off the scent, should
  they determine to prosecute me.

  At sixty pages, it may take some time to read the complete text to the police officer,
  so I will attach an extension cord to the telephone and drag it into the bathroom,
  and make my call while nestling in a tub of hot milk of magnesia. Over the past
  year I have bought a couple of those little blue-glass bottles every week, and should
  have enough to fill the bath. I will heat the milk of magnesia using Professor Tadaaki''s
  Submerged Iron Filament contraption, the label on which claims it can boil a few
  gallons of any known liquid within thirty seconds. Of course, I do not need to boil
  my bath, far from it. Tadaaki does not provide a thermometer, but I have one somewhere,
  in a cupboard, and as soon as I have completed this journal entry I shall go in
  search of it.

  After the telephone call, the bath, and my supper, I will put the thermometer back
  in the cupboard and set a roaring fire in the grate. As I have no coal, nor wood,
  I will burn the beheaded vipers, for there are many of them and I suspect they will
  ignite well. I dried them thoroughly by putting them in the airing-cupboard under
  a pile of blankets. The blankets, incidentally, were not stolen. I wove them myself,
  when I was a child, and capable of weaving at the loom for hours upon end, humming
  old Latvian folk tunes to myself. In those long ago days I could never remember
  the words to the songs, except for one, and that only partially. In papa''s translation,
  it went like this: "There is a shepherd in the hills / There is a [something] green
  / But black is the crow in the [something] tree / And lightning blasts the sky /
  The shepherd''s lass has golden hair / She [something something] milk / But the
  crow has flown away, my love / And the ducks have left the lake".

  It''s time I made that telephone call.

  ON THE AIR

  Today sees the fourth programme in the weekly series Hooting Yard On The Air, broadcast
  on ResonanceFM (see top of page for details). I thought readers might enjoy a behind-the-scenes
  look at how the show is made.

  Four or five hours before transmission time, the recording studio is thoroughly
  disinfected by a crack squad of specialist cleaning workers dressed in what look
  like astronauts'' outfits. They are armed with a panoply of highly intriguing tools,
  instruments and tweezers, many of which have no apparent purpose. The ResonanceFM
  HQ is, as some readers know, located in a subterranean basement far, far below the
  London streets, and is only accessible via an underground pneumatic-capsule railway
  system last used in the 1880s but which has been preserved, like a fly in amber,
  by a group of enthusiasts all of whom by weird coincidence are named Tim, as their
  fathers were before them.

  When disinfection is complete, other preparations are made. Antique bakelite canisters
  are distributed to dozens of eager factotums (or should that be factota?). Grease-pans,
  handled by imperious and jewel-dappled kitchen staff, are lowered into magnificent
  neoclassical oven-like pods of questionable--though remarkable--significance. Any
  stray toads are ushered violently from workspaces. A xylophone, abandoned after
  an earlier programme, is yanked off its hinges and hurled zestfully into a yellow
  xylophone waste vat. Urgent telecommunications signals are read and reread quickly,
  then plastered on to oblong cards which are nailed to murals in one of the many
  lobbies. Knots are tied in jumpers. Incredibly huge golden flaps have to be emblazoned
  with diamond patterns. The dank cellar of the building is then aired.

  Listeners are often surprised to learn that Frank Key does not actually appear on
  the show himself. His place is taken by an actor named Ludovico Boole. Boole''s
  ability to mimic the vocal inflections of anyone he chooses is matchless, and he
  has had a long and successful career doing so. Other impersonations he has essayed
  include Sir Isaiah Berlin, Tuesday Weld, both Richard and Karen Carpenter, and President
  Nixon''s henchman H R Haldeman, of Watergate fame.

  An hour before Hooting Yard On The Air is broadcast, Boole is collected from the
  roof of his seaside compound by a helicopter disguised as an air ambulance, and
  flown to one of the termini of the pneumatic railway on the outskirts of London.
  For security purposes, a different terminus is chosen each week, the decision being
  made by the chopper pilot during the flight.

  Safely ensconced in the ResonanceFM HQ, Boole is handed the week''s script together
  with the meal he insists on as part of his contract: four bloaters, a bowl of boiling
  hot custard, breadcrumb flan, and a jug of thoroughly-diluted potato extract. Wiping
  his mouth on a monogrammed napkin, Boole then enters the studio and begins to read...


  BATS

  Having your blood sucked by a vampire bat can be an alarming experience, and not
  at all like being bled by leeches. In the latter case, you are likely to be attended
  by a kindly apothecary or physician, who will apply the leeches and make reassuring
  noises. Alternatively, you may be trudging through a swamp, and leeches will fasten
  upon your legs and begin to drain your blood, but in such cases you are unlikely
  to notice them, as you will be half-submerged in the swamp, therefore in your ignorance
  of the leeches you will not be frightened. A vampire bat is likely to attack you
  without warning, however, and so you will be alarmed.

  Many folk make the mistake of lumping in pipistrelle, Egyptian fruit, red, long-nosed,
  little brown, pallid, western mastiff, serotine, pocketed free-tailed, woolly false
  vampire, hoary, Indiana, northern, ghost-faced, greater horseshoe, Brandt, Honduran
  white, Natterer''s, lappet-browed, noctule, Ipanema, tent-making, big brown, evening,
  yellow, spotted, Nathusius pipistrelle and other bats with vampire bats, and thus
  being fearful of them all. But only the vampire bat will plunge its fangs in to
  the soft white flesh of your neck and begin to drain you of your vital gore. If
  you are awake, and especially if you are active, for example playing lawn tennis,
  orienteering, or doing outdoor carpentry, you will be able to fight off the vampire
  bat. Remember that you are bigger and stronger than it is, and be not afraid.

  On the other hand, if you are fast asleep, and unprotected by an anti-bat curtain
  of heavy purple brocade, the vampire bat may suck your blood uninterrupted, until
  its thirst is sated. If you are the bat''s first victim for a while, it may drink
  all of your blood, and you will not wake up, because you will be lifeless. Do not
  believe those foolish stories about waking after a visit from a vampire bat and
  tentatively feeling punctures in your neck and thenceforth being a kind of undead
  human version with a bloodlust of your own. That will only happen if you live in
  Transylvania and bear a resemblance to Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney. Note that Lon
  Chaney is not to be confused with Lyn Cheney, wife of the current US vice-president.

  AT THE DUCKPOND

  Imagine that you are standing beside a duckpond. Perhaps you are holding a plastic
  bag filled with the torn-up remains of a loaf of bread with which you intend to
  feed the ducks. You have been known to do such a thing, on a Sunday morning perhaps,
  come rain or shine. Now, what I want you to consider is as follows. Do you think
  there are any circumstances, whether on a Sunday morning or at any other time, when
  you might look at the famished expectant ducks paddling towards you, and single
  out one particular duck, and say to yourself, "Hmm, that duck looks lugubrious"?

  Can a duck take on a lugubrious air? This is no idle question. For whether the answer
  is Yea or Nay, further and more cogent questions present themselves, tumbling over
  each other in their urgency to be answered. "If so, how?" or "If not, why not?"
  are clearly the next in line, but it does not stop there. To arrive at honest answers
  to all the succeeding questions will take all your wit and insight, and a knowledge
  not only of ducks and other waterfowl but of biology and psychology and the engines
  of perception and optics and so on, ad infinitum. You see, as each question begets
  another, by the time you have finished answering them--not that you will ever really
  finish answering them, more that you will faint from exhaustion--you will know everything
  there is to know about everything in the universe.

  That being so, the lugubrious duck has earned its crusts of bread a thousandfold.
  So feed it now, before you swoon.


  "HE HEARD ONLY THE SOUGHING OF THE..."

  "He heard only the soughing of the wind, the hissing pelt of raindrops in the scrub
  oak. Sickened fear assailed him, then; fear, not for himself but for the girl he
  loved. He remembered the dark, sinister threats uttered by Lige Ludwell, and he
  recalled how Lige''s daughter had died. Maybe Brenda was even now hanging suspended
  head-downward somewhere, her life-blood being drained from her veins, either by
  vengeful clansmen or by something worse . . . such as an undead vampire-corpse .
  . . Until tonight, he would have scoffed at such an eldritch, hellish fancy. But
  in view of what had already happened, a cold slime of horror slid into his marrow."
  -- Robert Leslie Bellem, Blood For The Vampire Dead


  AT HOME WITH TANQUOD SHUDDERY

  I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought some
  custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and
  a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and
  the Pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a
  flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras. I went to the shops and bought
  some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras
  and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap
  and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds.
  I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin
  of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and
  grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch
  and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and a jam tart and four and
  twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin and then I went home and took each
  item out of its paper bag, and put the paper bags on the fire, and smoke billowed
  up the chimney, and I saw that it was good, and I declared that it was good, in
  a loud voice, so loud that my neighbours came a-running, they tumbled into my room
  in their stockinged feet, and I stood there like a Jack o''Lantern, with my custard
  and brooch and flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of Hudibras and my jam tart and
  four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin, and I said to my neighbours
  "Behold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighbourly folk, behold and wonder,"
  and they did, and I made a pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their
  cups from the pot, and my shopping I distributed to my neighbours as gifts, and
  their hearts grew warm, and that is what happened when I had what is called an "At
  Home", in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the farm, where cows graze and hens
  cluck, and the farmer has gone to seed.
