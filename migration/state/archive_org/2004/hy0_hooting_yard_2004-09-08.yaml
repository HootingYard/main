full_text: 'NAME THAT CUR

  One of the most common misconceptions in the world of cur-nomenclature is the idea
  that many dogs bear the name Fido because its Latin meaning (I trust or I am faithful)
  has some bearing on perceptions of canine personality. Dobson, for one, saw through
  this nonsense, as he explained in his out-of-print pamphlet On The Naming Of Curs
  As Fido : A Stern Corrective. He wrote:

  What never seems to occur to people is that there is not one single recorded instance
  of any dog being called Fido prior to World War II*. This stark fact alone is surely
  all the evidence any rational person needs to realise that dogs are named Fido in
  honour of the Petroleum Warfare Department''s successful development of the "fog,
  intensive dispersal of" system, otherwise known as FIDO. I cannot be bothered to
  go into the details of how, in 1944, boffins managed to make mist and fog vanish,
  for all the world like mediaeval magicians, but they did, God knows they did. Furthermore,
  the connection between dogs and fog is well known, as anyone who has studied some
  of my earlier pamphlets will know.


  A fairly standard type of cur

  * NOTE : Much as one admires the magisterial tone of Dobson''s pronouncement, he
  is, of course, quite mistaken.


  ESCAPE FROM A SHIP ON FIRE

  Escape From A Ship On Fireis a Chewist text, in which every other sentence is taken
  from an anonymous piece of the same title published in the Missionary Annual of
  1833. Chewism is named after Dobson''s amanuensis Marigold Chew, who pioneered the
  technique of "stitching" a new text within an existing one in this manner. Note
  the startlingly modern approach of our 19th century author, who ignores the outbreak
  of fire and launches straight in to the escape...

  There were about four score of us, to use Biblical numbers. Many of the party, having
  retired to their hammocks soon after the commencement of the storm, were only partially
  clothed when they made their escape; but the seamen on the watch, in consequence
  of the heavy rain, having cased themselves in double or treble dresses, supplied
  their supernumerary articles of clothing to those who had none. I myself gave my
  hood made out of compressed wheat to a Jesuit priest who had been taking confessions
  from the stowaways when the tempest struck. We happily succeeded in bringing away
  two compasses from the binnacle, and a few candles from the cuddy-table, one of
  them lighted; one bottle of wine, and another of porter, were handed to us, with
  the tablecloth and a knife, which proved very useful; but the fire raged so fiercely
  in the body of the vessel, that neither bread nor water could be obtained. We were
  able to turn the tablecloth into a makeshift tarpaulin, and I chuckled at the appropriateness
  of its embroidered scene of ducks plashing in a pond.

  The rain still poured in torrents; the lightning, followed by loud bursting of thunder,
  continued to stream from one side of the heavens to the other,--one moment dazzling
  us by its glare, and the next moment leaving us in darkness, relieved only by the
  red flames of the conflagration from which we were endeavouring to escape. Verily
  it was like unto the fires of hell, the flaming pit, and it would be no exaggeration
  to say that the licking flames took on the appearance of fiends armed with pitchforks
  to poke at the damned.

  Our first object was to proceed to a distance from the vessel, lest she should explode
  and overwhelm us; but, to our inexpressible distress, we discovered that the yawl
  had no rudder, and that for the two boats we had only three oars. Those were the
  oars I had varnished back in port. All exertions to obtain more from the ship proved
  unsuccessful. The acrid stench of burning oars and rudders and tallow and chandlery
  assailed us. The gig had a rudder; from this they threw out a rope to take us in
  tow; and, by means of a few paddles, made by tearing up the lining of the boat,
  we assisted in moving ourselves slowly through the water. I tried to keep up our
  spirits by singing a shanty, but my voice was cracked and broken and I got no further
  than the first nine stanzas. Providentially the sea was comparatively smooth, or
  our overloaded boats would have swamped, and we should only have escaped the flames
  to have perished in the deep. Throughout my life I had suffered from nightmares
  wherein I was gobbled up in the jaws of some eldritch aquatic being resembling a
  giant squid with pulsating suckers, and now I feared that all those tossing and
  turning nights had been a premonition of my actual doom.

  The wind was light, but variable, and, acting on the sails, which, being drenched
  with the rain, did not soon take fire, drove the burning mass, in terrific grandeur,
  over the surface of the ocean, the darkness of which was only illuminated by the
  quick glancing of the lightning or the glare of the conflagration. But what could
  account for the hissing and seething noises, like a thousand deranged baby pigs,
  now soft, now deafeningly loud, which seemed to be pursuing us in our hectic progress?

  Our situation was for some time extremely perilous. Ach, the damnable sea! The vessel
  neared us more than once, and apparently threatened to involve us in one common
  destruction. Great crashing waves tumbled over us and we gibbered in terror; then
  one old salt developed a massive nosebleed which he tried to staunch with a roll
  of bandage he had looted from the purser''s cabin just before we abandoned ship;
  he knew he would hang for theft, but a brute sense of survival had him pulling at
  an oar with one hand and fumbling with the bandage with the other. The cargo, consisting
  of dry provisions, spirits, cotton goods, and other articles equally combustible,
  burned with great violence, while the fury of the destroying element, the amazing
  height of the flames, the continued storm, amidst the thick darkness of the night,
  rendered the scene appalling and terrible.

  I noticed that even in the midst of the mayhem, our ship''s artist, Binnie, was
  scribbling frantically in his tattered and seawater-soaked sketchpad, drawings which
  would one day go on show at some godforsaken seaside museum, unvisited and unsung.
  About ten o''clock, the masts, after swaying from side to side, fell with a dreadful
  crash into the sea, and the hull of the vessel continued to burn amidst the shattered
  fragments of the wreck, till the sides were consumed to the water''s edge. At five
  past ten, an angel appeared momentarily in the black forbidding sky, or it may have
  been a guillemot. The spectacle was truly magnificent, could it even have been contemplated
  by us without a recollection of our own circumstances. Those circumstances were
  perilous indeed; only once before had I been involved in a burning shipwreck, and
  that had been child''s play in comparison.The torments endured by the dogs, sheep,
  and other animals on board, at any other time would have excited our deepest commiseration;
  but at present, the object before us, our stately ship, that had for the last four
  months been our social home, the scene of our enjoyments, our labours, and our rest,
  now a prey to the destroying element; the suddenness with which we had been hurried
  from circumstances of comfort and comparative security, to those of destitution
  and peril, and with which the most exhilarating hopes had been exchanged for disappointment
  as unexpected as it was afflictive; the sudden death of the two seamen, our own
  narrow escape, and lonely situation on the face of the deep, and the great probability
  even yet, although we had succeeded in removing to a greater distance from the vessel,
  that we ourselves should never again see the light of day, or set foot on solid
  ground, absorbed every feeling. Every feeling, that is, except one; and it may be
  that I speak only for myself, but among the jumble of terror and loss and despair
  and woe I yet had a vision of the pantry in my parents'' pie shop, its shelves stacked
  with jar upon jar of pickled and jellied blubber products which remarkably, even
  in this ferocious cataclysm, made my mouth water.For some time the silence was scarcely
  broken, and the thoughts of many, I doubt not, were engaged on subjects most suitable
  to immortal beings on the brink of eternity. I myself took comfort in my pie shop
  pantry thoughts.

  The number of persons in the two boats was forty-eight; and all, with the exception
  of the two ladies, who bore this severe visitation with uncommon fortitude, worked
  by turns at the oars and paddles. Good Victorians that they were, despite it being
  the year 1963, the ladies darned socks and cooed gentle hymns as the storm blustered
  around us. After some time, to our great relief, the rain ceased; the labour of
  baling water from the boats was then considerably diminished. Our feet, nevertheless,
  were drenched, except for those of the wily sailor who had smeared the lower half
  of his body with boar''s grease. We were frequently hailed during the night by our
  companions in the small boat, and returned the call, while the brave and generous-hearted
  seamen occasionally enlivened the solitude of the deep by a simultaneous "Hurra!"
  to cheer each others'' labours, and to animate their spirits. Throwing pingpong
  balls across the storm-tossed seas from one boat to the other was another way of
  coping with our predicament.

  The Tanjore rose in the water as its contents were gradually consumed. The flames
  roared pitilessly. We saw it burning the whole night, and at day-break could distinguish
  a column of smoke, which, however, soon ceased, and every sign of our favourite
  vessel disappeared. Dawn was approaching. When the sun rose, our anxiety and uncertainty
  as to our situation were greatly relieved by discovering land ahead; the sight of
  it filled us with grateful joy, and nerved us with fresh vigour for the exertion
  required in managing the boats. I wondered if by some freak of chance we had lit
  upon the Island of Abundant Spinach, of which I had so often read. With the advance
  of the day we discerned more clearly the nature of the country.

  Alas! It was wild and covered with jungle, without any appearance of population:
  could we have got ashore, therefore, many of us might have perished before assistance
  could have been procured; but the breakers, dashing upon the rocks, convinced us
  that landing was impracticable. Stuck in our boats, we tried to chat about mundane
  things; railway timetables, soup recipes, the film career of Rex Harrison. In the
  course of the morning we discovered a native vessel, or dhoney, lying at anchor,
  at some distance: the wind at that time beginning to favour us, every means was
  devised to render it available. By now most of us were too exhausted to row, even
  the sailor with the nosebleed, who had collapsed and was lying in the bottom of
  the boat for all the world like a felled marble statue of a magnificent god. In
  the yawl we extended the tablecloth as a sail, and in the other boat a blanket served
  the same purpose. I have not mentioned the blanket before, for reasons which even
  the most astute reader can only guess at; let us just say that this blanket''s warp
  and weft were not of this earth, nor of any imaginable planet. This additional help
  was the more seasonable, as the rays of the sun had become almost intolerable to
  our partially covered bodies. Despite there being a gang of violent pagan sun-worshippers
  aboard, we cursed that bright and battering orb. Some of the seamen attempted to
  quench their thirst by salt water: but the passengers encouraged each other to abstain.
  It is astonishing how determined one can be if faced with a crack on the skull from
  a gas canister.

  About noon we reached the dhoney. Every last one of us had survived that terrible
  night. The natives on board were astonished and alarmed at our appearance, and expressed
  some unwillingness to receive us; but our circumstances would admit of no denial;
  and we scarcely waited till our Singalese fellow-passenger could interpret to them
  our situation and our wants, before we ascended the sides of their vessel, assuring
  them that every expense and loss sustained on our account should be amply repaid.
  The very next day, I set sail once more, alone, bound for Greenland, little knowing
  that I would twice more be imperilled on the vast and thundering ocean, dashed against
  rocks and almost drowned in bilgewater, before I would once again step over the
  threshhold of the pie shop, the prodigal daughter returning to her shrivelled and
  infected parents, home, home from the sea.


  EIGHTEEN QUESTIONS

  Where are the snows of yesteryear? The snows of yesteryear have been safely bagged
  up in burlap sacks and placed in a frozen pit.

  Am I allowed to remove one of the sacks from the pit? You may remove one sack from
  the frozen pit if authorised to do so.

  How do I gain authorisation? You may gain authorisation by prostrating yourself
  before a plinth atop which stands a robot duck, the control mechanisms of which
  have been deactivated.

  Why have the control mechanisms of the robot duck been deactivated? The control
  mechanisms of the robot duck have been deactivated because a bug in the program
  meant that the duck was prone to fits of illogical and haphazard scampering about
  and its great size and sharp metal feathers imperilled the people out strolling
  in the vicinity of the plinth, forcing them to jump into the flowerbeds. Much soil
  was thus scattered and strewn, and flowers would have been damaged had any remained
  in the beds.

  Where have all the flowers gone? The flowers have been plucked from their beds with
  botanic pincers and removed to a place of safety.

  Are you allowed to divulge the location of the flowers? The current location of
  the flowers rescued from the rampages of the robot duck is top secret.

  Is there a blue dahlia among the flowers? There is not a blue dahlia among the flowers,
  for all the flowers are chrysanthemums, every last man jack of them.

  Who are the people you mentioned strolling in the vicinity of the plinth? The people
  strolling in the vicinity of the plinth atop which stands a deactivated robot duck
  include two famous campanologists, an organ grinder, and many people who resemble
  koala bears.

  Was that a full and frank answer to my question? That was a partial answer. Full
  and frank details of all those strolling can be accessed in a database maintained
  online at www.blodgettglobaldomination.com/plinths/robotduck/vicinity/passersby/list.html

  What has Blodgett got to do with this? There is no fleck of human activity which
  has not been dangled from the fingertips of Blodgett.

  How do you dangle a fleck? Flecks dangled by Blodgett were dangleable flecks.

  Did Blodgett ever meet Stalin? Blodgett met Stalin on a number of occasions, either
  at Stalin''s dacha or at Blodgett''s abandoned gasworks. Their meetings were generally
  both convivial and fraught, veering from conviviality to fraughtness and back again
  within seconds. They also kept up a hectic correspondence which has not yet seen
  the light of day.

  Did Blodgett allow Stalin to dangle some of his flecks? Stalin dangled many of Blodgett''s
  flecks, but only after issuing a ukase which forced Blodgett''s hand.

  Was Blodgett still alive when Stalin died in 1953? Blodgett was still alive at the
  time of Stalin''s death, but he died soon afterwards.

  What was the cause of Blodgett''s death? The cause of Blodgett''s death was calenture.

  What is calenture? Calenture is the name given to various fevers occurring in the
  tropics, especially to a form of furious delirium accompanied by fever, among sailors,
  which sometimes led the affected person to imagine the sea to be a green field,
  and to throw himself into it. That is how Blodgett died, bless his cotton socks.

  Where is Blodgett buried? Blodgett''s remains were interred in the same frozen pit
  wherein lie the burlap sacks containing the snows of yesteryear.

  Does that mean that if I prostrate myself in front of the plinth atop which stands
  the deactivated robot duck and gain permission to remove one of the burlap sacks
  of snow from the frozen pit I could at the same time pay obeisance to the relics
  of Blodgett? Yes.


  GIGANTIC BALLS OF VOLATILE GAS

  Have you, or someone you know, got a great anecdote about gigantic balls of volatile
  gas? Why not share it with our readers? At one time or another, all of us have been
  confronted by unimaginably vast orbs of gas, glowing perhaps, or even pulsating
  eerily, as if about to explode, unleashing destruction and doom. It seems a shame
  to keep your experience to yourself. Perhaps you were traumatised, and begin to
  gibber and drool when recollecting what happened? Or maybe you have tried to shut
  out the memory entirely, so that only in your nightmares do you revisit the scene?
  Whatever your own way of dealing with monstrous, bright, spherical gas phenomena,
  we will be pleased to hear from you. The most riveting submissions will be collected
  in a forthcoming Hooting Yard anthology, for which we have already signed up Perry
  Como to write the preface. Some readers will be aware that Mr Como unfortunately
  crossed to the Other Side on 18th May 2001. He will be dictating his preface, via
  an angel, to a spirit medium yet to be appointed (possibly Yoko Ono)..


  Perry Como : sprightly preface from beyond the grave


  PINING AND POTHORST

  The continent of America takes its name from Amerigo Vespucci, but here at Hooting
  Yard we have decided to promote the case for Dietrich Pining and Hans Pothorst.
  Sixteen years before Columbus, this pair of roguish German pirates may well have
  been the first Europeans to set foot in the New World, alongside Johannes Scolnus,
  a Polish seafarer who may or may not have existed in the first place. Wily Dietrich
  and Hans kept getting chased further north by the Danes, and they regularly sailed
  to Greenland to be piratical. It is thought they may have accidentally blundered
  ashore in Labrador in 1476. Whether they did or not, the United States of Pining
  And Pothorst Land seems to me to be a far more evocative name than the United States
  of America, so that is how we shall henceforth refer to it.

  Incidentally, some years after this voyage, Pining and Pothorst settled on a rock
  called Hvitsark, some way off the coast of Iceland. According to Olaus Magnus, Archbishop
  of Uppsala, in his Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus (Rome, 1555), "they lived
  there outlawed with their fellow-rovers and inflicted many atrocities on every seafarer,
  whether sailing close at hand or at a distance", and built a lead compass atop the
  rock to help them in determining the shortest direction to go in their "profitable
  plundering forays." This compass can be seen in the superb map of Scandinavia made
  by Olaus in 1539 and published, as luck would have it, in Ulm. The map, together
  with exciting details, and much other pleasurable material, can be visited by clicking
  on this small section of it below, where Pining and Pothorsts''s compass is indicated
  by that circle about a third of the way down on the left hand side, to the west
  of Iceland.
