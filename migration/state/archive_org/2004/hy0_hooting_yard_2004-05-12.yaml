full_text: 'HELLO DARKNESS MY OLD FRIEND

  I''ve come to talk with you again. I''ve had a nightmare about a hen. I''d been
  abandoned, in my pyjamas, in a desolate fen. The hen approached me, clucking. Seldom
  have I heard so eldritch a cluck from a domestic fowl. I was thoroughly unnerved.
  In the nightmare, believing that I had awoken, I was chewing my pillow and my mouth
  was full of feathers and I began to choke. But I did not wake. The hen pecked at
  something on the ground. I was no longer in a fen. I was standing in the middle
  of a field splattered with buttercups, holding a big iron slab of dubious utility.
  I looked at it very carefully, and saw that a stanza of Emily Dickinson''s had been
  scratched on it: Its little Ether Hood--Doth sit upon its Head--The millinery supple--Of
  the sagacious God. Now I was spectacularly terrified! The Belle of Amherst dream,
  that had plagued me for two decades until Dr Snap prescribed his balm and unguents,
  had returned to haunt me! Somehow I was conscious that I was thrashing about in
  my bed and yet I remained transfixed in sleep. The noise made by the hen grew louder.
  Knowing that "a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid",
  I looked desperately around me. Though I could hear it, the hen had vanished. The
  iron slab weighed heavy. Now I was knee deep in water. I began to shout, echoing
  Edgar Allan Poe''s dying words: "Reynolds! Reynolds! ... Reynolds!" At the last
  cry, mercifully, I awoke. I jumped out of bed immediately and plunged my head into
  a nearby pail of icy water. Then I went to the window, and looked out at the bright
  morning. Rustic farmyard persons were trudging up the hill over by Bodger''s Spinney.
  A booby and a godwit sang.


  THE NAMES OF THE PONDS

  by Frank Key

  The first pond is called POSTAGE STAMP POND not, as one might think, due to its
  tininess--for it is indeed a tiny pond!--but because it was the scene of the 1898
  Postage Stamp Riots. You will recall from your schoolbooks that the introduction
  of a new machine at the sorting office led to unrest.

  The second pond is named MEE JAWR POND which is thought to be a corruption of the
  name Midge Ure. Mr Ure was a balladeer & minstrel of the last century, now largely
  forgotten, although there exists a dwindling band of devotees who gather together
  underneath railway bridges and viaducts to sing extempore versions of his profound
  meditation upon vapidity, Vienna--it means nothing to me. Appropriately enough,
  this pond is unfathomably deep.

  The third pond, everybody''s favourite, is called POND O'' CAKES. It was in this
  pond, on a teeming day in April in the year of the Munich Air Disaster, that a canister
  of protoplasmic goo from another dimension was found in the fishing-net of a little
  tike named Chevenix Perkins. Young Perkins was the only-begotten son of the disgraced
  insecticide merchant Slawkenbergius Perkins, late, not of this parish, but of another
  parish entirely, where eldritch groans and wailings would often be heard emerging
  from dilapidated barnyards and abandoned bomb shelters, the like of which--the groans
  and wailings, that is--no human ear ought ever be suffered to hear in this brief
  mortal existence. (That sentence is a translation from the original Hungarian.)
  Little Chevenix gave his find to the Museum At-or-Near-the-Gruesome-Copse at Ack,
  from where it has since disappeared.

  Pond number four was for a long time nameless, but has recently been dubbed BIRDS''
  POND because of the masonry pillar just to the north, on which is inscribed this
  sentence from John Burroughs'' Birds And Poets (1877) : "The defiant scream of the
  hawk circling aloft, the wild whinny of the loon, the whooping of the crane, the
  booming of the bittern, the vulpine bark of the eagle, the loud trumpeting of the
  migratory geese sounding down out of the midnight sky; or by the seashore, the coast
  of New Jersey or Long Island, the wild crooning of the flocks of gulls, repeated,
  continued by the hour, swirling sharp and shrill, rising and falling like the wind
  in a storm, as they circle above the beach or dip to the dash of the waves,--are
  much more welcome in certain moods than any and all mere bird-melodies, in keeping
  as they are with the shaggy and untamed features of ocean and woods, and suggesting
  something like the Richard Wagner music in the ornithological orchestra."

  The fifth pond, WORSE-THINGS-HAPPEN-AT-SEA POND is barely what you would call a
  pond at all. It has been called a puddle. Some have dubbed it a mere. One authority
  on landlocked pools of water has called it a tarn, albeit inaccurately, as it is
  at (or at least near) sea level. It would appear that the appellation "authority"
  is thus equally inaccurate, although few have questioned it, as the pond-boffin
  concerned is none other than Cloris Preen, niece of the notorious Lothar, and ex-wife
  of the beetle-browed turps magnate Hengist Shad. Cloris Preen''s Universal Gazetteer
  of Ponds, Meres & Similar Bodies of Water Across The Globe, Indexed By Depth, Hue
  & Mean Temperature, With Thousands of Diagrams & Lots & Lots of Exciting Maps is
  reputedly the longest single-volume book ever published, although most scholars
  hold it in contempt. Worse-Things-Happen-At-Sea Pond is notable for the weird iridescent
  glow it emits on certain saints'' feast days, usually those of St Bartholomew (24th
  August), often invoked against nervous diseases and twitching, St Ambrose (7th December),
  patron saint of beekeepers and wax refiners, and St Rita of Cascia (22nd May) patron
  saint of desperate cases. Should Cloris Preen be classed as a desperate case?

  We come now to FIENDISH POND, home to a bewildering array of aquatic life forms
  which I am afraid I have not had time to catalogue. Some of them look like monsters
  from H P Lovecraft--and those are the less frightening ones! Terrorised infants
  can often be seen running away screaming from this pond, only to become entangled
  in a nearby thicket of nettles and bindweed, the poor mites.

  Shuddering, let us attempt to push the tentacled and sucker-festooned denizens of
  Fiendish Pond to the backs of our minds and consider instead MARY MOONMAN POND,
  named after one of the key witnesses to the assassination of John F Kennedy on 22nd
  November 1963. Her name is (was?) in fact Mary Moorman, but the blond, swashbuckling
  ne''er-do-well who painted the signboard affixed to a wooden post stuck in the mud
  to the southwest of the pond was hard of hearing, and his error has never been corrected.
  In any case, Mary Moorman, or Moonman, ought better be known as Marymoon Man, thus
  more appropriately named alongside her fellow witnesses Badge Man, Umbrella Man,
  Black Dog Man, and far too many more Men than we have space for here. This seems
  as good a time as any to throw in the little-known fact that alleged assassin Lee
  Harvey Oswald was interred under the name William Bobo.

  From Mary Moonman Pond, strike east, tread carefully around the Place of Strewn
  Grotesque Pebbles, and you will find yourself within spitting distance of PARACELSUS
  POND named, of course, for the 16th century alchemist Theophrastus Philippus Aureolus
  Bombastus von Hohenheim, the man whom all abecedarians hold in high honour, as among
  his coinages were both alcohol and zinc. Of more concern to us here is the way in
  which faint yet compelling links and patterns can be traced across the centuries.
  Mention has already been made of the turps tycoon Hengist Shad, whose fortune was
  based on the oleoresins exuded from coniferous trees consisting of more or less
  viscid solutions of resin in a volatile oil, and lo! we find that the very same
  turpentine was an essential constituent of Paracelsus'' celebrated weapon-salve,
  the recipe for which was as follows: Take of moss growing on the head of a thief
  who has been hanged and left in the air; of real mummy; of human blood, still warm--of
  each, one ounce; of human suet, two ounces; of linseed oil, turpentine, and Armenian
  bole -of each, two drachms. Mix all well in a mortar, and keep the salve in an oblong,
  narrow urn. [My emphasis.] The supposed linkage may seem tenuous, if it were not
  for the fact that the very next pond we stumble upon is called..

  HUMAN SUET POND. Reads like an anagram, doesn''t it? And indeed it is, for this
  is an artificial pond--obvious from its perfectly ellipsoid shape--which was dug
  in 1962 by one Thomas Pundune (anag.) to mark the publication of Richard Milhous
  Nixon''s book Six Crises. Careful study of the pond reveals half a dozen partly
  submerged plastic baubles, each of which is designed to represent one of the then
  future president''s half-dozen formative events, the most exciting of which--I refer
  to both bauble and crisis--is the "goodwill" tour of South America in 1958, when
  Nixon and his wife, the saintly Pat, were attacked and nearly killed by pro-Communist
  mobs in Venezuela. Pundune was a great admirer of the only Quaker ever to order
  the bombing of Cambodia, although he underwent his own "crisis" in 1971--the details
  are blurry, but it had something to do with a yeast infection--disavowed Nixon,
  pond and baubles, and retired to a Bewilderment Home on a bleak hillside. He may
  still be there, haunted, ancient and drooling, for all I know. But his pond remains
  a very lovely thing, and has always been popular with the picnicking element.

  Next on our fascinating tour is Pangfabuloquislinguette Pond, known colloquially
  as MUCH-DRAGGED POND as it has the distinction of being the most frequently dragged
  pond in the land. The police forces of this bailiwick--and there are at least seven
  different so-called Law Platoons who claim it as their own--all have a perplexing
  mania for sending frogmen equipped with forensically-approved nets into the pond
  at the least opportunity. Sometimes they do not even wait for a crime to be committed.
  Scarcely a week goes by without a nylon fence being erected around this splendid
  pond, a team of yellow-jacketed walkie-talkie-wielding myrmidons materialising out
  of the blue, and then a series of faint splashes as the dashing frogmen set about
  their task. Their trawls have even been productive, on occasion. The grim--or perhaps
  grimy--poisoner Gervase Tanquod was convicted on the basis of a phial of smee riddled
  with his fingerprints which he had tossed into the pond while pursued by bloodhounds.
  It proved to be the only evidence against him, yet it was--as the trial judge put
  it--"the hinge on which the case swings". (This judge, incidentally, was fond of
  ironmongery metaphors in his summings-up, and regularly invoked hinges, lever handles,
  snap hooks, latches, sealing lugs, padlocks, mobile aeration screens, safety chains,
  chink devices, transom window gears, espagnolette bolts, bevels, sash pulleys, pressed
  brackets and even fire tongs to illuminate his never less than draconian judgements.)
  Tanquod he sent to the jug for forty years, which amounted to a death sentence,
  as the fiend was already in his eighties when he was at last apprehended. Much-Dragged
  Pond has also been noteworthy as a popular location for film-makers, no doubt because
  as morning mists hang over its still surface (on those rare days it is not being
  dragged) it has a magical atmosphere, like one imagines Avalon, say, or Narnia,
  or the Blister Lane Bypass. Note too the solitary heron standing vigil at the edge
  of the pond.

  Of CLYTEMNESTRA! POND we need say nothing.

  VON PIGFLASK POND is named for Horst Helmut Von Pigflask, the noted percussionist,
  who created his own sonic universe using just a couple of biscuit tins, a thermos
  flask half-full of milk, and a few odds and ends scavenged from a rusting ship.
  "The milk," he famously declared, "must be sour, at least four days sour, or it
  has no ton, no timbre." At one time an habitue of the same Marseilles dockyard drinking
  dens as that scallywag Lothar Preen, Von Pigflask had a huge falling-out with his
  mentor on 12th October 1959. Despite both protagonists keeping voluminous--if not
  to say obsessive--diaries, neither of them has a word to say about this incident.
  Preen''s journal entry for the day is the usual vain, self-serving hyperbole, while
  Von Pigflask writes a long list of farm implements annotated with pencil-drawn symbols
  in some indecipherable private code. What can it all mean? The sad thing is that
  no one, then or now, ever really cared. On the following day, Von Pigflask hired
  a dinghy from one of his disreputable acquaintances, put out to sea, and vanished.
  Perhaps because his police files had been mislaid, his absence went unremarked;
  certainly there is no trace of him whatsoever until at some point in the late 1960s
  when reports began to circulate that he was a founder member of the blues-rock pioneers
  Blodwyn Pig. To this day the other original members, Mick Abrahams, Jack Lancaster,
  Andy Pyle and Ron Berg deny ever having heard of the great percussionist, let alone
  giving him free rein with his tins, flask and rusty flotsam on their debut album
  Ahead Rings Out. There is no doubt, however, that it was Von Pigflask himself who
  appeared unannounced on stage at the 1974 Jazz Festival in Ulm, where he performed
  a 16-second untitled improvisation before scuttling away into the tenebrous German
  twilight. Two more years passed before his triumphant return to the world stage,
  the patching up of differences with Preen, and the ear-splitting genius of his late
  work. In 1996, by now aged and suffering increasingly from the bindings, he retired
  and settled in Winnipeg. His final years were spent on the upper floors of a gleaming
  skyscraper, where he took great pleasure in his pet tortoise and worked for hours
  every day on a seemingly endless list of anagrams of Pol Pot, Ayn Rand, U Thant
  and Yoko Ono.

  STAGNANT INKY-BLACK FATHOMLESS SPOOKY POND is the thirteenth and final pond in this
  survey. How ill-named it is! Tiny ones may well flee screaming from Fiendish Pond,
  as we have seen, but not from here. On the contrary; it is not uncommon for beadles
  and matrons from the Parish Home for Poor Wretched Mud-Splattered Orphans to bring
  their charges here for an afternoon of gambol and frolic. O how the air rings with
  the joyous cries of the tots as they play pin-the-paper-to-the-cardboard, sitting
  at the edge of the pond with their grubby little feet splashing in the water! How
  they gobble down their small tin bowls of custard and watercress with toothsome
  relish! If you, as an adult, dear reader, need to have your heart''s cockles warmed,
  why not join one of the regular charabanc excursions which leave from Haemoglobin
  Towers at noon every Thursday, and witness this scene for yourself? The cost is
  reasonable--not "criminally expensive" as one curmudgeon wrote in a letter to the
  Hooting Yard Bee--and if you bring your own packed lunch you can even join in the
  antics! Pray heaven that you do not give credence to that other Bee correspondent
  who wrote a farrago of nonsense about getting bats entangled in his hair! Nor ought
  you listen to malicious gossip about the pond being riddled with vivid blue poisonous
  toads. A brisk walk around the pond will soon diffuse the diesel fumes from the
  charabanc, and you will no longer have a headache.


  "A LITTLE, SLIGHT MAN, WITH A THIN,..."

  "A little, slight man, with a thin, clever, mobile, clean-shaven face, a sharp inquisitive
  nose surmounted by a perpetual pair of pince-nez, and a rather sarcastic mouth,
  from which wit and humour as light and airy as the cigarette smoke which accompanied
  each remark continually flowed. He stands on the hearthrug of his own special sanctum
  in his handsome house in Dorset Square, with his back to the fire, cigarette in
  his mouth, his hands now in his pockets, now waving in the air, as he vivaciously
  tells me the story of his busy, energetic and wonderfully interesting life." --
  Raymond Blathwayt, George Grossmith And The Humour Of Him


  PANG HILL NEWS

  Whatwhatwhat? Has Pang Hill Orphanage burned to the ground again? They must cease
  the use of blubber-candles forthwith. I know such lighting is cheap, but three conflagrations
  in as many months is evidence of sheer stupidity. At least the tinies were ushered
  to safety, scampering around the duckpond in their tunics while Mister Von Stroheim
  tried to gather them together for counting. Why on earth did he think that asking
  them to sing "Conquistador" by Procol Harum would becalm them? Alas, it had the
  usual effect, and instead of a placid duckpond-edge''s-worth of orphans neatly lined
  up, he had to deal with tears and wailing and breast-beating and religious fervour
  and mischief and duck-taunting and drenchings and jiggery-pokery and panic and hopelessness
  and fisticuffs and spillages and mitten-loss. The reporter from the Weekly Shackle
  observed only one child filling a pail with duckpond water and carrying it over
  to the orphanage to combat the flames. Such a heroic tot! I shall make sure he is
  given a new pair of socks. It was not his fault that the bottom of the pail was
  half eaten away with rust, and that by the time he had crossed the prize-winning
  Condoleezza Rice Flower Garden and was within yards of the inferno, there were only
  a few meagre droplets of duckpond water left, and a fat lot of use they were, as
  "brilliant orange flames licked and curled around the charred cinders of what had
  once been Pang Hill''s finest orphanage". Surely the flames would have died down
  by the time there were cinders to be seen? But that bit is a quotation from the
  reporter, a man who knows his onions, or so I have been told. Apparently the dispatches
  he sent from the Bodger''s Spinney Beehive Building Competition were so well-written
  that he was offered a job on the Daily Agony In The Garden, but he turned it down,
  unwilling to leave Pang Hill, whose snowdrops, cow parsley and phlox soothed his
  nerves, he said, and he was fearful that if he did not daily look upon them he would
  be bedizened and turn into a splinterbrain. As for the craven Mister Von Stroheim,
  I''m going to have his guts for garters when I lay my hands on him.

  ON THE AIR

  Today sees the fourth programme in the weekly series Hooting Yard On The Air, broadcast
  on ResonanceFM (see top of page for details). I thought readers might enjoy a behind-the-scenes
  look at how the show is made.

  Four or five hours before transmission time, the recording studio is thoroughly
  disinfected by a crack squad of specialist cleaning workers dressed in what look
  like astronauts'' outfits. They are armed with a panoply of highly intriguing tools,
  instruments and tweezers, many of which have no apparent purpose. The ResonanceFM
  HQ is, as some readers know, located in a subterranean basement far, far below the
  London streets, and is only accessible via an underground pneumatic-capsule railway
  system last used in the 1880s but which has been preserved, like a fly in amber,
  by a group of enthusiasts all of whom by weird coincidence are named Tim, as their
  fathers were before them.

  When disinfection is complete, other preparations are made. Antique bakelite canisters
  are distributed to dozens of eager factotums (or should that be factota?). Grease-pans,
  handled by imperious and jewel-dappled kitchen staff, are lowered into magnificent
  neoclassical oven-like pods of questionable--though remarkable--significance. Any
  stray toads are ushered violently from workspaces. A xylophone, abandoned after
  an earlier programme, is yanked off its hinges and hurled zestfully into a yellow
  xylophone waste vat. Urgent telecommunications signals are read and reread quickly,
  then plastered on to oblong cards which are nailed to murals in one of the many
  lobbies. Knots are tied in jumpers. Incredibly huge golden flaps have to be emblazoned
  with diamond patterns. The dank cellar of the building is then aired.

  Listeners are often surprised to learn that Frank Key does not actually appear on
  the show himself. His place is taken by an actor named Ludovico Boole. Boole''s
  ability to mimic the vocal inflections of anyone he chooses is matchless, and he
  has had a long and successful career doing so. Other impersonations he has essayed
  include Sir Isaiah Berlin, Tuesday Weld, both Richard and Karen Carpenter, and President
  Nixon''s henchman H R Haldeman, of Watergate fame.

  An hour before Hooting Yard On The Air is broadcast, Boole is collected from the
  roof of his seaside compound by a helicopter disguised as an air ambulance, and
  flown to one of the termini of the pneumatic railway on the outskirts of London.
  For security purposes, a different terminus is chosen each week, the decision being
  made by the chopper pilot during the flight.

  Safely ensconced in the ResonanceFM HQ, Boole is handed the week''s script together
  with the meal he insists on as part of his contract: four bloaters, a bowl of boiling
  hot custard, breadcrumb flan, and a jug of thoroughly-diluted potato extract. Wiping
  his mouth on a monogrammed napkin, Boole then enters the studio and begins to read...


  AN EXTRACT FROM OBSEQUIES FOR LARS TALC, STRUCK BY LIGHTNING

  by Frank Key

  Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in memory of Lars Talc. How can I do justice
  to the memory of such a man? Let me say this. He owed me a great deal of money.
  He was covered in dust. He couldn''t tell the difference between a heron & a moorhen.
  He never learned the rules of ice hockey. He was often plagued by mysterious boils.
  He had a scar on his left shin. He confused the different metallic elements. His
  hair was often unkempt. He set fire to a bible. His pigs were neglected. Adept at
  pingpong, he weighted his bat. He once suffered from scrofula. His tent had many
  holes. He never wore a hat. His gas bills drove him crackers. He spoke umpteen languages.
  His mother told me he was terrified of swans. Geology was beyond him. He hankered
  for doilies. He counted toads. His bath was made of tin. His first marriage was
  disastrous. He could not ride a bicycle. He spat out mayonnaise. He avoided paying
  for hotel rooms by clambering down fire escapes. Once he built his own bridge. He
  burned himself in effigy. He loved to eat turnips. He often drooled. His thumbs
  were deformed. Rust and rime engaged his attention. He was much travelled. He designed
  his own pen-nibs. He kept a photograph of Ricardo Montalban in his bureau. His eyesight
  was atrocious. Candles have been lit for him. His credentials were spotless. He
  punched a fishmonger. He gutted huts. Linctus slithered down his throat. He owned
  dozens of fret-saws. He thought the moon was his lover. In Didcot he wept. He fed
  flamingos with cream crackers. In certain circles his name was mud. He kept his
  gutta-percha in a gunny sack. The sight of geese made him anxious. He smoked cheroots.
  He re-counted toads. He held aloft a blubber-lantern on the banks of a duckpond.
  His saliva was bitter. Taxes were levied upon him. He had a zest for crumpled things.
  In parks he pondered. He bit his fingernails. He chewed spinach. At a pinch he would
  talk for hours on the subject of straw. He wiped his bottom with leaves. He wrote
  a book about gnats. He mumbled through a tube. Things dangled from the ceiling of
  his boudoir. He lost on the horses. He wrapped a tortoise in blankets. As a youth
  he survived on crusts. His father painted difficult maps. Often he behaved like
  a madman. Twigs and branches fell unremarked in his garden. Rowing held no allure
  for him. He dabbed at his brow with ointments. He was fond of cormorants. He coaxed
  mice from their nooks. He was knocked down by a runaway bus. Clods of earth surrounded
  him. He could be petulant. He strained things in a muslin net. He pulverised a diving
  board with his bare hands. Morse code baffled him. He nearly became a marine. He
  moved his arms towards the lake. Under a cow tower he looked at planks. He overcame
  his stutter. His sheep had worms. He crossed himself. He played at bagatelle. He
  spied a crocus. He fainted. He snored. He panted. He sprayed. His stomach. His hearing
  aid. His cuffs. His gristle. His sponge. His batteries. His hardship. His chutney.
  His paths. His windows. His calcium. His rudders. His vinegar. His seeds. His nettles.
  His sores. His stool. His plastic. His incandescence. Autumn. Shipwreck. Curtains.
  Exile. Frost. Balconies. Pandaemonium. Hedgerows. Banisters. Carpets. Hinges. Remembrance.
  Hair. Custard. Dribble. Fanfares. Dampness. Bauxite. Trousers. Canals. Boskage.
  Lasciviousness. Tunics. Spigots. Iron. Cranks. Floozies. Doppelgangers. Tin. Bales.
  Agony. Loss. Lust. Love. Crack. Bang. Crunlop. Lars Talc is dead.'
