full_text: 'THE PHOLOGISTON VARATIONS

  Good afternoon. Welcome to hooting yard on the air. My name is Frank key. This week
  I''m going to read you a record review, a review of a CD, a fairly lengthy review
  which appeared in the in the weekly shackle that wonderful family newspaper. And
  it''s a review of the phlogiston variations by Winslow and a CD set mid price. unwrapping
  the cellophane from this handsome box set took me the best part of an hour, such
  as my excitement that the word butter fingers might have been invented for me. And
  it was only by dint of a pair of extremely sharp scissors that I eventually succeeded.
  That was not the end of my troubles, for I had the devil of a job to discard the
  shredded wrapper into my wastepaper basket. gleaming strands of cellophane stuck
  resolutely to my fingers. However desperately I flapped my arms around, like a conjurer,
  casting a peculiarly inept spell. is this relevant? Well, yes, I think it is. The
  tactile struggle to extricate the box from its packaging was nothing compared to
  the auditory struggle I then underwent, listening at one sitting to the nine hours
  and 47 minutes of the quite majestic phlogiston variations. Younger listeners may
  be unfamiliar with the work of the Alaskan Flemish composer chlorine and Dinah Winslow
  1882 to 1941. operates operetta the paving slabs was recently revived by a troupe
  of Finnish amateurs. And the jazz spin ethicist Dennis Jarrett included a version
  of the retention of milk on his 1991 solo album. But otherwise, this towering figure
  of 20th century music has fallen victim to almost criminal neglect. So this reissue
  of the phlogiston variations, recorded by the hooting yard ensemble in 1959 is more
  than welcome. And well I hope go some way towards the rehabilitation of Winslow.
  I''ve never understood why she''s been all but forgotten. At the peak of her success
  in the 1920s. Her works were regularly performed in concert hall throughout the
  world, and critical plaudits were bestowed on her even by such cantankerous misanthropes
  as Wrigley, who described her memorably as the greatest Alaskan composer of the
  last and probably the next 500 years. Winslow had in fact left Alaska at the age
  of four. Her mother, a weasel breeder of Flemish extraction, fled the country after
  her husband Winslow''s father was shot dead in one of the sporadic outbreaks of
  gang warfare which blighted a fog neck island in the Gulf of Alaska during the 1880s.
  Mother and daughter moved first to Sumatra, then traipse through various seaside
  resorts in the north of England. before settling in Danzig in 1896. Winslow had
  shown a precocious talent as a bassoonist and her mother enrolled her in some sort
  of cut price music school in the city, run by Professor ignatz milkbone. A wisdom
  an old get of questionable morals, whose police record filled at least two hole
  filing cabinets in the basement storeroom of the Danzig, Western District criminal
  justice headquarters. He was a foul foul man, and a teacher of genius. Winslow studied
  under him for 11 years in all in that time, she developed from a promising teenage
  bassoonist into an all round musical talent of frightening proficiency. Her first
  composition proper. The suite for String Quartet large drum train whistle caster
  nets and medicine balls, was written when she was 17. At the very end of the 19th
  century, she was anticipating the innovations that Shrek rent Willis and Toad brow
  would take credit for 20 or 30 years later.

  One winter''s morning in 1907, Professor milkbone was arrested in the middle of
  Winslow''s glockenspiel lesson. He was charged with multifarious crimes to all of
  them She confessed and in prison for a very very long time. This was a decisive
  event for the young composer. Her teachers pedagogy was so rich, so omniair for
  cumulative that have broken from him voluntarily was near impossible. In time, no
  doubt it would have stifled the wild and inventive creative impulse to which Winslow
  now gave free rein. forced by circumstances to go her own way. She embarked on a
  series of works which, to those of us privileged to have heard them continue to
  astonish the IRS decades after they were written. This is not the place to attempt
  to buy a biographical sketch of coring Winslow. In any case, her life was one of
  unremitting tedium, as attested by Sidney ollege, who complained to the absence
  of even the team the windiest speck of interest in her life, after milkbone had
  been packed off to jail. Nonetheless, between 1907 and her death in 1941, Winslow
  created a corpus of work arguably unrivaled by any of her contemporaries. The ideas
  spilled out of her with dizzying fecundity. The phlogiston variations completed
  in 1929, is well to remind ourselves her Opus 954 she began work on the variations
  in 1924. Planning first a set of linked cantatas to be sung by a boy''s choir to
  the accompaniment of a brass band, eight separate orchestras, a pickup jazz combo,
  and an amateur ensemble from the Danzig metallurgical Institute, performing upon
  a motley collection of laboratory equipment. The first section to be completed the
  passer Kalia and ritual execution for Viola and masked Bunsen burners was abandoned,
  to be revived in the final score transformed into jouett for exhaust pipe and whimpering.
  She wrote most of the sulfurous, impenetrability and spleen in the gutter movements
  before a commission from the job and government to compose a new national anthem
  forced her to put the variations aside for a couple of years. Then, throughout 1927,
  she was embroiled in the disentanglement of Professor milk bones of state. He had
  died on some finished his day still in prison, and had made Winslow the executor
  of his will. Not until December 1927. To to manage to track down the principal beneficiary
  one pansy cradled you, the professor''s sixth cousin eight times removed, who lived
  in a log cabin in the midst of snow and gales somewhere in the vastness of Greenland.
  The variations were completed in a frenzied bout of work during the first half of
  1929 and first performed in October of that year, in a butter cup splattered field
  within the grounds of the metallurgical Institute, with Winslow herself conducting
  and playing the trombone. reviews were uniformly ecstatic. James Pilger in the metals
  field Gazette proclaimed that having experienced this music, I would happily be
  struck Deaf tomorrow. Strangely enough, this is precisely what happened. The following
  day. pilc was lunching as usual in his club when a man of gigantic stature of wild
  appearance bore down upon him and kept a pair of symbols repeatedly about his is

  Tin Pan Alley sought. aggrieved at pillbugs withering review of his musical play
  Jasper Courtney''s electrical wiring system in the previous week''s Gazette. peleg
  never regained his hearing, and was forced to retire as the newspapers music critic.
  For a time he wrote gardening columns and reported on local beekeeping activities.
  But in his despair, he turned to drink and died three years later in the waiting
  room of Michael''s field railway station. He was just 32. But I digress.

  Winslow wrote the libretto of the variations herself. It was based upon Joseph Priestley''s
  the doctrine of phlogiston established and that of the composition of water refuted
  1800 Priestley had argued that phlogiston was a substance or principle supposed
  to exist in combination in all combustible bodies. In other words, it was the very
  matter of fire itself. The hypothesis had first been expanded by style in 1702.
  By the time Priestley published his work a century later. It fallen into disrepute.
  Most scientists by then considering it to be nonsensical rubbish. Priestley stoutly
  maintained his belief in the existence of phlogiston. And it was this willful independence
  of mind which attracted Winslow, her priestly as a tragic hero Wittering on about
  his theories, the text of the libretto taken verbatim from his book, while a so
  called pompous chorus of scientists tries to shout him down. I''m just going to
  have a sip of water at this stage.

  Such as the massive scale of the work that following the 1929 premiere, no one attempted
  a complete performance again until the hooting yard ensembles recording 30 years
  later. Winslow included excerpts from the variations in a number of her concerts
  during the 1930s but it was considered too formidable of score for anyone else to
  have a crack at it. In his autobiography, the conductor Ted darky, beloved, gave
  a revealing account of the general reluctance to perform the work he wrote. I remember
  hanging around in a Marseille Tavern with a bunch of internationally successful
  conductors, as we sank jar after jar of tough metals ale. Our talk ranged over the
  entire history of Western music. We try to outdo each other, arguing for our own
  interpretations of various works with definitive, majestic, timeless performances
  which left nothing further to be said. For example, Horst grudge claimed that his
  series of Helsinki concerts, in which he performed all 49 binders symphonies made
  any future approach to them a complete waste of time. No sooner had he said this,
  then Vaughn pig flasks patentees beer, and countered that his own version of binders
  20th, recorded with the Ivory Coast state radio orchestra was absolutely the last
  word on the piece. That binders granddaughter had been present in the studio and
  had wept great buckets of tears. And what''s more grudges handling of the visit
  Carter had been otiose laughable and the subject of derision among all his Vonn
  pig flask pounds grudge did not take this lying down. Immediately he let rip with
  a contemptuous diatribe upon the failings of Vonn pig flasks 1949 version of our
  heads chocolates was roll Sonata pausing only to let the waiter bring more drinks
  and to mop up the spillages and vomit. He then launched into a tirade on the virtues
  of his unscathed not Taub concertos, provoking bag brain who sat beside me to tip
  the content of his tankard over grudges head. And so it went on until someone or
  other it might even have been me, mentioned Winslow''s phlogiston variations. For
  the first time that night there was silence around the table. The first to speak
  was poor old Sopwith, but he was by now so drunk that none of us could understand
  a word he said. But at least he''d had the courage to say something. Taking our
  cues each of us in turn admitted that enormously talented as we were, our Titanic
  egos shriveled at the prospect of tackling Winslow''s masterpiece. to attempt it,
  we felt was to risk cataclysmic failure. That evening, I confessed for the first
  time to my recurring nightmare, in which I stood down from the podium after conducting
  performance of the variations, to be met with uproarious laughter, a hideous combination
  of ridicule and contempt, and the cackling den grew louder and louder until I woke,
  bathed in sweat, and nearly suffocating myself with a pillow. That''s the end of
  the extract from to darky billigste memoir. But enter then lo thar preen the principal
  conductor of the hooting yard ensemble, and a man every bit as vain and next and
  extravagantly boof, haunted as the gang in Billings memoir. Indeed, so convinced
  was praying of his own genius that he held himself aloof from the Society of his
  fellow conductors. preen had made his reputation with his tremendous 1952 rendering
  of our heads. Surgical opera Starling cured my palsy. In 1957, he replaced winter
  mark as commander in chief of the hooting yard ensemble, and he astonished the players
  that his first meeting with them we gathered together in a little hot hard by the
  banks of the river recalled the accordionist durveys calc.

  All of a sat there on wooden spools and makeshift stage had been erected at one
  end of the room on which had been placed a sumptuous armchair. We''d been waiting
  about half an hour when preen crashed in, skipped onto the stage and flung himself
  into the chair. He lit up a cigarette Oh, and glared at us. A rustle of sniggering
  swept across the hat as we registered the extravagance of his Buffon. He did not
  stir. Five minutes elapsed until preen extinguished the butt of his cigarillo in
  a milk bottle half filled with water, which he then put into his tote bag. Then
  noisily clearing his throat he spoke. You are all musicians, he said. And if how
  winter mark is to be believed musicians have the highest caliber matches and your
  ability to tackle the most difficult works that the present day composer can throw
  at you. Is that correct? Not one of us was able to speak for we will completely
  thrown by our new maestro''s accent. Eventually, though, we managed a collective
  mumble of diffident assent. Good, continued preme Very good. That being the case
  he screeched, I have it in mind to lay down before you a challenge which my fellow
  conductors have to date shied away from. I intend to SAP for life blood from your
  veins, you will wish you had never been an egg in my mother''s womb, ha. You and
  I are going to astonish the world. We have two years. You might think it a long
  time, a child can learn to speak and walk in that time, but our task will be harder,
  infinitely harder. For tomorrow we embark upon that philologist on variations. Never
  imagined to do things by half printed obtained Winslow''s original manuscript laborious,
  Lee laboriously he wrote out by hand multiple copies sufficient not only for each
  member of the ensemble, but also for the additional players whom he knew would be
  necessary for the accomplishment of his ear shattering design. This has led to some
  controversy over the real authorship of preens version, as Winslow herself never
  made a recording of the work. And as the manuscript was burned to ascend in the
  conflagration, which destroyed preens house in October 1969. Only those present
  at the 1929 premiere still alive and in possession of gramophone players 30 years
  later, are able to compare the two versions. To date, researchers have identified
  only four people who fit the bill. One of budgerigar enthusiasts from Samarkand,
  now resident in a mental and mental institution, to a Genovese antiquaries struck
  deaf and dumb by a traumatic hiking accident. Three a shambling alcoholic from Burbank
  whose memory is unimpaired, but who speaks only in gibberish. And for a bus conductor
  from ironically mackerels field, who was only six months old when his exiled White
  Russian parents dangled him on their knees at that historic 1929 concert. Another
  area of contention surrounding the preme variations concerns the instrumentation,
  Winslow''s full orchestras were paired down of necessity to the limitations of the
  14 piece ensemble, brass band and Boys Choir were replaced by a hurdy gurdy and
  a specially trained cat with some electronic implants, most controversially print
  dispensed all together with the jumble of laboratory equipment, introducing in its
  place of sonically dissimilar barn yards worth of farm implements to be played by
  an octet of hyperactive three year old high from a nearby pediatric Institute. insurance
  premiums demanded by the children''s parents were preposterously high, and the Ensemble''s
  management board refused to pay them. preme had no money of his own. his salary
  was paid direct to an organized crime syndicate in Borneo which was blackmailing
  him, but such as his obsession with the phlogiston variations, that he struck a
  macabre bargain with the parents. If he said, any of the infants were to meet with
  even the tiniest accident, while rehearsing or performing upon the farm implements,
  he would slay his entire family, subject the members of the ensemble to unimaginable
  tortures, tear out his own beard hair by hair with a large pair of pliers and ground
  himself in a barrel of fish oil. He signed the statement to this effect and had
  it witnessed by a priest a judge at a higher rate. ranking military officer then
  distributed copies to each of the parents.

  Ah, but he was a canny one. He also gave the names and addresses of the parents
  to the crime syndicate in Borneo, alleging that they were police spies ready at
  any moment to swoop armed with incontrovertible evidence of the syndicates malfeasance.
  For the time being, he said he could hold them off, but the first word from him,
  they must dispatch murderous Cutlass wielding thugs from their HQ, and strike down
  the parents. Otherwise, their worldwide criminal empire would be snuffed out in
  an instant. As soon as the gang acknowledged receipt of his communicate preme collected
  the tops in his van settled him into the hastily constructed nursery camp rehearsal
  room, and unleashed them upon the farm implements. His sister Hattie was installed
  as their tutor, and she soon had them creating the most exquisite noises as they
  frolicked among the churns bindles bean stubble rakes, sub soil, pulverizer plows,
  clotting, Mel''s potato grading shovels and golf pincers. Another member of the
  premium family the blag oddly, uncle, rip was employed to convert an abandoned aircraft
  hangar into a recording studio. his appointment was dubious, he had neither the
  qualifications nor the skills to undertake such a task. preen harangue the management
  board into paying his uncle a ludicrous sum, all of which was promptly salted away
  into one of rips notorious in misadventures, boldly praying demanded even further
  funding. He visited each member of the board in turn at the dead of night, accompanied
  by a brutish myrmidon supplied by his uncle. Not surprisingly, more money was made
  available. This time it was used to finance uncle rips starch factory in North Africa.
  But then, a third attempt to pride cash from the board was unsuccessful. Using the
  same tactics as before, premium his henchmen turned up at the house of the board''s
  president at three o''clock on a bitterly cold February morning. They pounded on
  the door, but then was startled to be set upon by a blood Christ starving Panther
  unleashed from its cleverly disguised layer on the roof. Prince suffered lacerations
  to the head and chest, and his Buffon was terribly disarranged. But he was luckier
  than his accomplice, who had an arm torn off and bought the imprint of razor sharp
  fangs in his forehead for the remainder of his wretched life. The president of the
  Management Board of a hooting yard ensemble stood smirking in his doorway, wrapped
  in a tremendously stylish dressing gown, and told lowth are praying that uncle rip
  had been arrested late in the previous evening, and was even as they spoke, being
  roughed up by the doubt Inspector kargh pan and his boys down at the police station.
  Oh, and if prayin wanted to build his gigantic recording studio, he''d have to do
  the job himself, he wouldn''t receive another penny from the board. chastened, the
  great conductor vowed that his plans would be realized. For the next two years he
  worked like a maniac rehearsing the ensemble by day and single handedly building
  the studio at night, fiddling about with complicated electronic bitty Bobs in the
  cavernous interior of the hangar, sweating in the heat generated by a dozen industrial
  lanterns he had stolen from the side of important roadworks on the blister lane
  bypass. Eventually, on the sixth of March 1959, everything was ready. On that day,
  the hooting yard ensemble with auxiliary hurdy gurdy cat, an infant, directed by
  Lothar preme played the phlogiston variations, recording their performance in a
  single take of nine hours and 47 minutes. There were no overdubs. What we can hear
  on these CDs is the music exactly as it was played. The grinding noises in the first
  movement, the percussive barrage of the second, the wistful harp and flagey a lot
  melody, drowned out by the battering of farm implements which begins that well loved
  scrofulous battalions section. It''s all here. Curiously timeless. Sound pimpled
  fractious, describe the eight fangfang various pockets putative and small bi reflect
  the appropriate Candace florentin giedrius, khunde, flad and snat. You know, pour
  James pill was right after listening To this you might as well go deaf. There''s
  no other music I know of which builds a sound world so breathtaking

  that absolutely everything else you ever hear will seem pale charmless and flaccid.
  Even my own sex tech for strings, dishwater and Tannoy, a 14 hour epic on which
  I have worked for 20 years, and which I brought to a resounding conclusion this
  morning, the very morning on which the posting limped towards my front door bearing
  the phlogiston variation CD box. Well, that was a few hours ago now. I''ve written
  this review in a sort of frenzy, sitting at my desk wristwatch, my pencil tearing
  across the paper in human speed. The floor is littered with peanut shells. For as
  always, I''ve been trumping my way through hundreds of peanuts as an aide to concentration.
  In a few moments, I''ll shove these pages into an envelope addressed to the editor
  of the weekly shackle and our bed mini to trot off to catch the last post. I will
  sweep up the peanut shells. I will take a bath and print my Buffon. It is not quite
  as preme like extravagance, but I''m nurturing it carefully. I will pull myself
  a generous shot of 45% proof bestie or freak and recline upon my purple sofa. When
  my tumbler is drained and I''ve rinsed it out, then and only then will I venture
  into the garden armed with a petrol cannon a box of matches. I will place the manuscript
  of my sextet, on which the ink is not yet dry into my sturdy incinerator, douse
  it in petrol and drop in a lighted match. As the flames crackle, I will no doubt
  begin to sob. The tears running freely down my cheeks glowing in the heat of the
  Blaze. I will be destroying the work which has occupied me and obsessed me for two
  decades. But now, having heard Winslow''s phlogiston variations, I know in the very
  deepest recesses of my soul that they have been wasted years.'
