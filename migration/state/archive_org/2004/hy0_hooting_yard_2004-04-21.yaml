  Captain Flask, of the HMS Corrugated Cardboard, was a bad and dangerous man. He
  never washed his hair, and he was fond of tormenting badgers. His ship was falling
  apart, because whenever any of his miserable crew tried to repair something, like
  the rigging, or a fo''c''sle, or even the whole orlop deck, he would fly into a
  rage like something out of the Old Testament, and the crew would be cowed, and go
  back below decks to their scrimshaw and grog.

  Every day, all day, and every night, all night, Captain Flask lurched around the
  deck, shouting at the sky. In the pocket of his weskit, where his fob watch ought
  to have been, he kept a supply of tin baubles, and he would throw these at any birds
  that came within his range, particularly guillemots, which he loathed, and cormorants,
  which he did not understand, but his aim was not good, and he usually missed.One
  of his arms was withered from scrofula.

  His fob watch lay, abandoned, in the untidy drawer of his escritoire, hidden among
  old pencils, bits of calico, drawing pins, bottle tops, cornflakes and dust. Every
  morning at six o'' clock, or whatever that is in maritime parlance, Captain Flask
  drank a whole pint of milk of magnesia.

  Oh, he was such a bad man! Such a dangerous man!


  MRS GUBBINS THROWS A FIT

  Dark clouds lour''d, and hailstones began to ping upon the pavement. Inside Haemoglobin
  Towers, Mrs Gubbins and her eighty-three-year-old colleague Daisy De''Ath were putting
  the finishing touches to their new software development, Pump-Action Graffix Hub
  1.0, already being touted as "a harbinger" by Technobilge magazine.

  "Would you care for a cup of tea, dear?" asked Daisy, noting that Mrs Gubbins was
  panting asthmatically and mopping her brow with a dainty handkerchief embroidered
  with a pattern of crocuses, hollyhocks, mealy bugs, and spurge. Daisy had always
  been famed for her solicitude.

  "Ack..." gasped Mrs Gubbins.

  "Tsk! You''re getting yourself all flustered, Mrs Gubbins," said Daisy, a little
  sharply, "Just because you forgot to insert a backslash into the command line for
  the ActiveX Pod System Tray Default."

  Reminded of this peccadillo, Mrs Gubbins became even more agitated, toppled off
  her ergonomic extruded-plastic workstation seating module, and landed on the floor,
  threshing about in an alarming fashion.

  "Dearie me," muttered Daisy to herself, and resolved at once to call an ambulance,
  despite the storm which was now raging outside like something from the imagination
  of the painter John Martin. She flipped through her Rolodex looking for the telephone
  number of the Bodger''s Spinney Ambulance Station, which was close by, but without
  her spectacles--which she had unaccountably left in the office kitchenette while
  making some Bovril earlier--she was as good as blind. "One of these days I''ll forget
  my own head!" she chuckled, in her fluting croak.*

  Meanwhile a stream of drool was flowing from Mrs Gubbins'' thin-lipped mouth, and
  her head was turning green ...

  * NOTE : Pedantic readers may argue that a croak cannot be fluting, but they have
  not heard Daisy De''Ath speak. Oh, and by the way, you will be pleased to know that
  Mrs Gubbins made a full recovery, before an ambulance arrived, by dint of the first
  aid skills of Matilda Choctaw (so spritely for a ninety-one-year-old!) who skipped
  into the office at the ellipsis above.


  ISTVAN & ZOLTAN

  "Crikey!" exclaimed Istvan, "What in the name of heaven is that?"

  His twin brother Zoltan looked up from the book he was reading. "Istvan, calm down,"
  he drawled, "You know I hate to be interrupted in my reading, especially when the
  book in my hands is the Journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins & I have just got to the
  entry for that most exciting day, 27th April 1871, when the poet, quote, mesmerised
  a duck with chalk lines drawn from her beak sometimes level & sometimes forwards
  on a black table, unquote."

  "How on earth can you immerse yourself in the prose of a Victorian Jesuit," screeched
  Istvan, "When I am about to be waylaid by a preposterously complicated mechanical
  contraption somehow imbued with almost human malevolence?"

  Zoltan yawned. "I have long been fascinated by Hopkins," he averred, "Incidentally,
  were you aware, o twin, that the nuns whose drowning was commemorated in that majestic
  poem The Wreck of the Deutschland lie buried in Saint Patrick''s Roman Catholic
  Cemetery in Leytonstone, east London, & that I have placed flowers on the grave?
  Peonies, I recall, or mayhap they were pinks, or pansies."

  "Eek!" yelled Istvan. Zoltan cast his eyes in the direction indicated by the frantic
  gesticulations his twin brother made to complement his frightful ''eek''.

  "Golly!" gasped Zoltan, his eyes popping. For trundling at inhuman speed towards
  Istvan was a monstrous steam-powered engine, bulky & strange, built of tungsten,
  titanium & tin, & seemingly alive with a perplexing array of hooters, levers, flaps,
  nozzles, chains, bleepers, consoles, klaxons, chocks, struts, decoy shields, Coddington
  lenses, batteries, prongs, bits of corrugated cardboard & Mackenzie beams. It was
  the Indigestion Machine!


  THE DISGUSTING BILGE OF CADET VIG

  Cadet Vig''s bilge was disgusting. Most people remember him as the so-called "tiny
  cadet", but I always think of his bilge. He kept it in a pail in his locker. I wrote
  the sign for him: Cadet Vig''s Locker--Keep Out--My Disgusting Bilge Is in Here.
  He wanted it printed in 24pt Gill Sans Condensed, but I told him to shut up, and
  scrawled it with my nib. I will tell you all about my nib another time, on a day
  when the astrological signs are favourable to my doing so, that is, Toxin in the
  Fourth House with Gymnopedies rising and Cack in the Funnel of Smew. That old bat-headed
  man with the bandaged ear tells me that this conjunction is unlikely to occur for
  the next two score years and ten, so you will have to be patient, just as Cadet
  Vig was. I made him wait a year and a half for his sign, suffering as I was from
  whitlows and scrofula, but he never, ever complained. I think that was admirable,
  particularly for a cadet renowned for his rigour. Well, I should say for his rigour
  and his bilge, and indeed his tininess. Gosh, was there ever a tinier cadet? I suspect
  not. I had my amanuensis trawl through the records, just in case a cadet tinier
  than Cadet Vig had trodden these blue corridors at some time in the inconceivably
  distant past, perhaps during the time of the Great Dismal Thaw, but alack! nothing
  was found. Now I sit slumped in my boudoir staring at the one photograph of Cadet
  Vig in my possession. He has a forlorn expression in the picture, and looks as if
  he is chewing something, or about to chew something. The air, perhaps. There is
  a hummingbird on his cap, but whether it is real or made of styrofoam is hard to
  tell--the photograph is blurred. I try so hard to pin these things in prose, but
  how could I ever compete with Beerpint''s poem? The old rugged cross / The cows
  in the field / [something, something] / And Vig [something]. Hand me that sandpaper.
  Crows have landed on the roof, and I have work to do.'
